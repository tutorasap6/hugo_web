Strengths-Based Partnership Approach in Immunization

1.Introduction        

Strengths-based and partnership approaches are necessary strategies for health care providers to use to promote immunization among families. Still, successful implementation of these strategies requires an understanding of how they elicit parental support and engagement. From depictions by Fogarty et al. (2018), strengths-based partnership approaches acknowledge that parents and caregivers have various skills, resources, and strengths that may be useful to the positive promotion of healthcare. While the strengths-based approach focuses on the positive contributions of parents and caregivers to a child’s health and development, the partnership approach recognizes the critical role that public health and clinical care providers can play in supporting parents as primary immunization motivators (Fortune, 2018).  This paper discusses how child and family health clinicians can promote immunization basing on a strengths-based partnership approach. It is portrayed that for immunization implementation to be effective, it ought to be considered not in isolation, but with reference to the wider socio-economic issues impacting a patient, as well as patient perspectives, resources, and input. The discussion therefore commences by briefly discussing key concepts relating to the topic, before delving into how family health clinicians can increase parental and caregiver confidence in immunization and encourage immunization uptake through a strengths-based partnership approach.

2.Overview on key concepts

2.1 Strengths-based and Partnership Approaches

According to Goldfield, Price, and Kemp (2018), a strengths-based and partnership approach involves a collaborative effort among health care providers, community members, and parents to provide the best quality of care for a child and family. The concept is portrayed further by Askew et al. (2020) as an approach that focuses on the whole person, by underlining what the person does best, as well as the resources at disposal that may help such a person to effectively cater to their health and health related challenges

# Strengths-Based Partnership Approach in Immunization

## Introduction

Strengths-based and partnership approaches are essential strategies for healthcare providers to promote immunization among families. Successful implementation of these strategies requires an understanding of how they elicit parental support and engagement. According to Fogarty et al. (2018), strengths-based partnership approaches acknowledge that parents and caregivers possess various skills, resources, and strengths beneficial to the positive promotion of healthcare. While the strengths-based approach emphasizes the positive contributions of parents and caregivers to a child’s health and development, the partnership approach recognizes the critical role that public health and clinical care providers play in supporting parents as primary immunization motivators (Fortune, 2018). This essay discusses how child and family health clinicians can promote immunization using a strengths-based partnership approach. It illustrates that for immunization implementation to be effective, it should be considered in the context of wider socio-economic issues impacting a patient, as well as patient perspectives, resources, and input. The discussion commences by briefly exploring key concepts related to the topic, before delving into how family health clinicians can increase parental and caregiver confidence in immunization and encourage immunization uptake through a strengths-based partnership approach.

## Overview of Key Concepts

### Strengths-Based and Partnership Approaches

A strengths-based and partnership approach involves a collaborative effort among healthcare providers, community members, and parents to provide the best quality of care for a child and family. Goldfield, Price, and Kemp (2018) describe it as focusing on the whole person, emphasizing what the person does best and the resources available to help them effectively address their health and related challenges. Askew et al. (2020) further emphasize this approach by highlighting its focus on identifying and leveraging the existing strengths and resources within the family and community to enhance health outcomes.

### Importance of Immunization

Immunization is one of the most effective public health interventions for preventing infectious diseases. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), immunization prevents an estimated 2-3 million deaths annually. It is crucial for protecting children and communities from vaccine-preventable diseases and maintaining herd immunity.

## Promoting Immunization Through a Strengths-Based Partnership Approach

### Building Trust and Rapport with Parents/Caregivers

Building trust and rapport with parents and caregivers is fundamental to promoting immunization. Healthcare providers should engage in open, empathetic communication, listening to parents' concerns and providing evidence-based information about the benefits and safety of vaccines. This approach helps to alleviate fears and misconceptions about immunization. By recognizing and validating parents' experiences and knowledge, clinicians can create a supportive environment that fosters trust and collaboration.

### Empowering Parents/Caregivers

Empowering parents and caregivers involves recognizing their vital role in their child's health and providing them with the tools and resources needed to make informed decisions about immunization. This includes offering educational materials, facilitating access to credible sources of information, and involving them in the decision-making process. Empowered parents are more likely to feel confident in their ability to support their child's health, including adhering to immunization schedules.

### Utilizing Community Resources

Community resources play a significant role in promoting immunization. Healthcare providers can collaborate with community organizations, schools, and religious institutions to disseminate information about immunization and provide convenient access to vaccination services. By leveraging community resources, clinicians can reach a broader audience and address barriers to immunization, such as transportation and access to healthcare facilities.

## Incorporating the Primary Health Care Principle of Equity

### Understanding Equity in Healthcare

Equity in healthcare refers to the fair distribution of resources and opportunities to achieve optimal health outcomes for all individuals, regardless of their socio-economic status, ethnicity, or geographic location. It involves addressing social determinants of health and reducing disparities in access to healthcare services.

### Promoting Equity in Immunization

To promote equity in immunization, healthcare providers must identify and address barriers that may prevent certain populations from accessing vaccination services. This includes offering immunization clinics in underserved areas, providing culturally sensitive care, and ensuring that information is available in multiple languages. By adopting a strengths-based partnership approach, clinicians can work with parents and caregivers to identify and overcome these barriers, ensuring that all children have an equal opportunity to receive vaccinations.

## Conclusion

A strengths-based partnership approach is a powerful strategy for promoting immunization among families. By building trust, empowering parents, and utilizing community resources, healthcare providers can enhance parental confidence and encourage immunization uptake. Incorporating the primary health care principle of equity ensures that all children, regardless of their background, have access to life-saving vaccines. Through collaborative efforts, child and family health clinicians can make significant strides in improving immunization rates and safeguarding public health.
