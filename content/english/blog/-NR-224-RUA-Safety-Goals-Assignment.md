## Summary of Brochure

Speak Up for New Parents is a
brochure that was developed in February 2021 as a guideline to help new mothers
understand some important things for you to look out for during pregnancy and
after birth. The goal for this Speak Up campaign is to help patients, as well
as their advocates get active in their care (TJC, 2021). This brochure targets
brand new mothers to help them understand that having a baby is a life changing
experience and lists some things to watch for while your body is going through
so many changes during pregnancy and after birth. The Joint Commission (TJC)
provides common signs and symptoms of hypertension, preeclampsia, hemorrhage,
infection, and depression. These are all serious and common risks of pregnancy.

## Communication

TJC communicates with the
audience what to do to prevent some of these things from happening and what to
do if you experience any of these things. For example, TJC listed common signs
and symptoms for preeclampsia and hypertension and then gave some tips. Those
tips are as followed: “never miss a prenatal visit, be sure your OB provider
checks your urine for protein, keep a record of your blood pressure so you will
know if it changes, count your baby’s kicks (TJC, 2021).” A common tip
throughout the brochure is open communication. For preeclampsia and
hypertension, the brochure says to contact your OB if you do not feel your baby
moving like normal. The normal amount of movement should be about 10 kicks per
hour. For signs of hemorrhage, it states to communicate with your OB if you are
anemic or have had any blood problems in the past. For infection, the brochure
says to ask visitors to wash their hands. Lastly, the brochure mentions to let
your OB provider know if you are experiencing any difficultly eating or
sleeping, feelings of helplessness or sadness, not wanting to get out of bed,
avoiding contact or bonding with your baby, or thoughts of wanting to harm
yourself (TJC, 2021). Open communication is the best way to make sure you are
decreasing your chances of these serious pregnancy complications.

## Personal Reflection

Pregnancy complications are an
important topic that should be talked about more frequently. Although, nobody
wants to discuss any kind of complications because they are scary it is
important to be educated about any possibilities that could happen. Personally,
I loved being pregnant, but it was scary because it was a whole new territory
and something my body had not yet been through. My pregnancies were not
complicated, but I do remember having some difficult conversations with my
husband during pregnancy and making plans for a “just incase this happens, this
is what we will do.” Luckily, we did not have to put any of our plans into
action. During pregnancy, it is important to communicate with those around you
who advocate for you (family, friends, whoever that may be) and your healthcare
providers so that they can help you if or when you need it. They are not mind
readers though, so if there is not an open line of communication, then they
will not know that you need help at all. 

## Evaluation of Brochure

This brochure has information
that is very beneficial for pregnant patients. As a future labor and delivery
nurse, this information will be something I pass on to my patients. TJC did a
great job clearly breaking down what to look for in the different complications
and giving tips for patients. However, I do feel like the brochure had too many
words. The few pictures that are on the brochure are small and not very
attention grabbing. I think they could have added some more pictures to make it
“flashier” to grab the attention of the audience. The information provided in
this brochure is supported by current nursing/medical journals which makes
these claims evidence based. As mentioned earlier, this brochure is targeted
towards new mothers but is great for seasoned mothers as well. Especially,
because not all women have their babies backto-back. Some women have big age
gaps between their children, so this brochure would be great for those women as
well because these are risks they may have forgotten about since their last
baby.

## Evidence Review & Application

According to Ghaedrahmati et. al,
postpartum depression is a high prevalence mental disorder. They mention that
postpartum depression could be associated with obstetrical history such as
hypertension and preeclampsia (Ghaedramhmati et. al, 2017). Making this
brochure more important for pregnant women.

## Conclusion

Overall, pregnancy to new mothers
is terrifying because it is an entirely new experience, but it is important to
talk about those common complications to help prevent them. Some of the major
pregnancy complications are hypertension and preeclampsia, hemorrhage,
infection, and postpartum depression. The best way to combat these problems is
to have open communication with your close friends, family, spouse, and
healthcare providers so that they can help. Following the brochure and
communicating with your healthcare provider when things do not seem right ill
help to decrease those at risk for any of these complications.
