### System Disorder: Ectopic Pregnancy

STUDENT NAME: Ashley Akuebionwu

DISORDER/DISEASE PROCESS: Ectopic Pregnancy

REVIEW MODULE CHAPTER: Chapter 7

***

#### ACTIVE LEARNING TEMPLATE: ASSESSMENT

***

SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS:

* Monitor for signs of rupture: Immediate surgical intervention may be required if rupture occurs.
* Assess for hypovolemic shock: Monitor vital signs, fluid balance, and signs of internal bleeding.
* Administer Rh immunoglobulin: If the client is Rh-negative, administer Rh immunoglobulin to prevent isoimmunization.

PATIENT-CENTERED CARE

***

Alterations in Health (Diagnosis):

* Ectopic pregnancy is an abnormal implantation of the fertilized ovum outside the uterine cavity, most commonly in the fallopian tubes.

Pathophysiology Related to Client Problem:

* Pathophysiology: The fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, often in a fallopian tube. The growing embryo can cause the tube to rupture, leading to severe bleeding and potentially life-threatening complications.

Health Promotion and Disease Prevention:

* Education: Encourage early prenatal care to detect ectopic pregnancies early.
* Prevention: Promote awareness of risk factors such as a history of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), previous ectopic pregnancy, or tubal surgery.

Risk Factors:

* Prior ectopic pregnancy
* Tubal surgery or sterilization
* History of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)
* Use of assisted reproductive technology (ART)
* Smoking

Expected Findings:

* Unilateral pelvic pain
* Vaginal spotting or bleeding
* Amenorrhea
* Shoulder pain (if there is internal bleeding)
* Signs of shock (if rupture occurs)

Laboratory Tests:

* Serum hCG Levels: Lower than expected for gestational age.
* Progesterone Levels: May be lower than normal, suggesting an abnormal pregnancy.

Diagnostic Procedures:

* Transvaginal Ultrasound: Will show an empty uterus, and may visualize the ectopic pregnancy in the fallopian tube or other locations.

Complications:

* Tubal Rupture: Can lead to severe hemorrhage and shock.
* Infertility: May occur due to damage to the fallopian tubes.

Therapeutic Procedures:

* Methotrexate: Medical management to dissolve the ectopic tissue if the pregnancy is detected early and unruptured.
* Laparoscopy: Surgical removal of the ectopic pregnancy, often necessary if rupture has occurred or if medical management fails.

Interprofessional Care:

* Obstetrician/Gynecologist (OB/GYN): For surgical management or follow-up.
* Radiologist: For performing and interpreting ultrasound imaging.
* Pharmacist: For administering methotrexate and other medications.

Nursing Care:

* Monitor vital signs: Regularly assess for signs of shock or hemorrhage.
* Provide emotional support: Address the emotional impact of pregnancy loss.
* Administer medications: Provide prescribed medications, such as methotrexate, pain management, and Rh immunoglobulin if necessary.
* Prepare for surgery: If surgery is needed, prepare the patient for the procedure and provide postoperative care.

Client Education:

* Signs and symptoms to monitor: Educate the patient on the signs of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, such as severe abdominal pain, dizziness, and fainting.
* Follow-up care: Emphasize the importance of follow-up appointments to monitor recovery and prevent future complications.
* Contraception advice: Discuss future fertility options and contraceptive use if desired.

Medications:

* Methotrexate: Used to medically manage unruptured ectopic pregnancy by inhibiting the growth of rapidly dividing cells.
* Pain management: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen.
* Rh Immunoglobulin: If the client is Rh-negative.
