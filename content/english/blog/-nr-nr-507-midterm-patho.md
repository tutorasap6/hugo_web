 NR NR 507 midterm patho

Question 1:
Which physiological characteristic makes infants highly susceptible to significant losses in total body water?
Student Answer:

* High body surface area relative to body size (correct answer)
* Slow metabolic rate
* Immature kidneys that are unable to adequately counter fluid losses (correct answer)
* Inability to effectively communicate thirst

Instructor Explanation:
The primary reason for an infant's vulnerability to significant fluid loss is due to the immature renal mechanisms responsible for regulating fluid and electrolyte balance. These mechanisms are often not fully developed, leading to a higher risk of rapid dehydration. Additionally, infants have a high metabolic rate and a larger body surface area relative to their total body size, which increases fluid turnover. The inability to communicate thirst only becomes a significant issue in cases where the infant is not receiving proper care.
