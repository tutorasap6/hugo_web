Caring is a fundamental aspect of nursing practice

Origin of the Model:

Caring is a fundamental aspect of nursing practice, yet its context within the nursing profession is continually evolving to align with modern healthcare practices and expectations. Numerous theoretical frameworks and models within nursing emphasize the centrality of the patient in care delivery. Among these, the Person-Centred Nursing (PCN) Framework, developed by McCormack and McCance in 2006, stands out as a model that emphasizes patient-centered care by focusing on creating an environment that promotes outcomes centered around the patient. This framework represents a multidimensional process that serves as a standard of care, aiming to ensure that the patient remains at the heart of healthcare delivery.

Meaning of the Model:

The PCN model, as articulated by McCormack and McCance (2017), is composed of five key constructs that collectively contribute to achieving person-centered care. These constructs include macro context, prerequisites, care environments, person-centered processes, and outcomes. The model is designed in such a way that individuals must engage with each construct, starting from the outermost circle, and progressively move towards the core to fully integrate patient-centered care into their practice.

An important update to the original PCN model was the inclusion of the macro context as the outermost ring of the model. The macro context encompasses broad factors such as health and social care policy, strategic frameworks, workforce development, and strategic leadership. This addition highlights the importance of considering the broader healthcare environment and policies that influence the ability to deliver person-centered care.

This model underscores the idea that achieving patient-centered care is not a linear process but a holistic one that requires attention to both individual and systemic factors. The framework provides a structured approach to integrating patient-centered care into nursing practice by ensuring that all relevant factors—from policy to personal interactions—are considered in the care process.
