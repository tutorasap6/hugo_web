### Assessment:

Differential Diagnoses:

1. Occupational Asthma:
   * Rationale: M.G.'s symptoms of SOB are associated with her work environment, where she is exposed to potential allergens such as flour dust. The relief of symptoms when away from work supports this diagnosis.
2. Allergic Rhinitis with Asthma Exacerbation:
   * Rationale: M.G. has a history of seasonal allergies and is currently taking Zyrtec as needed. Allergic rhinitis can contribute to asthma exacerbations, particularly in environments with allergen exposure.
3. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD):
   * Rationale: While M.G. does not have a significant smoking history, her father had lung cancer and her maternal grandfather had COPD, raising her risk for pulmonary conditions.

### Plan:

1. Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs):
   * To assess for any reversible obstructive airway disease, particularly in light of her symptoms at work.
2. Referral to Pulmonologist:
   * For further evaluation, including consideration of occupational asthma and potential need for work-related modifications.
3. Consider Trial of Inhaled Corticosteroids (ICS) or Short-Acting Beta-Agonist (SABA):
   * Depending on the results of the PFTs and further evaluation, a trial of ICS or SABA may be warranted to manage symptoms.
4. Allergy Testing:
   * Repeat allergy testing may be necessary to identify specific triggers in her work environment.
5. Patient Education:
   * Discuss the importance of avoiding known allergens and potential modifications at work to minimize exposure.
   * Educate about the potential for occupational asthma and the need for regular monitoring and follow-up.

### Follow-up:

* Reassess symptoms after initiating the treatment plan.
* Follow up in 1-2 weeks or sooner if symptoms worsen.
