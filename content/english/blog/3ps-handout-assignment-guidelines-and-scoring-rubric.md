3Ps Handout Assignment Guidelines and Scoring Rubric

Purpose:The purpose of this assignment is to integrate and synthesize advanced knowledge in three critical areas—pathophysiology, pharmacology, and health (physical) assessment—into three educational handouts designed for nursing students or staff nurses. These handouts should effectively communicate complex concepts related to the specific healthcare topic you chose in your Week 5 assignment.

Due Date:Sunday 11:59 PM MT at the end of Week 7

Total Points Possible:250

Assignment Description:For your final NR526 assignment, you will develop a set of three detailed handouts focusing on the topic you selected during Week 5.

Important Note: Each handout must provide an in-depth application of pathophysiology, pharmacology, and health (physical) assessment concepts relevant to your chosen topic. Each handout should thoroughly explore at least one core concept, though it may be necessary to cover multiple related concepts if they are integral to understanding the topic.

References:While you may refer to your course textbooks, it is essential to include at least one peer-reviewed article as a reference in each handout. Clinical practice guidelines are highly recommended sources, but other peer-reviewed articles that present evidence-based patient care are also appropriate.

Visual Aids:Feel free to incorporate images, concept maps, tables, or other visual aids to enhance the clarity and effectiveness of your handouts. You may use media that you create yourself or those available through the Chamberlain Library’s copyright resources: [Chamberlain Library Copyright](http://library.chamberlain.edu/copyright). If you choose to include links to video or audio resources, ensure they are relevant and enhance the content. Remember that current, relevant, and accurate content is the most critical aspect of your handouts. For clinical topics, "current" is defined as no more than five years old.

Developing the Handouts:

1. Pharmacology Handout:
   * Focus on one or more drugs related to the complex health situation you are addressing. You may concentrate on a single drug or, if relevant, discuss how multiple drugs work together or compare and contrast similar or alternative drugs.
2. Pathophysiology Handout:
   * Address the pathophysiology associated with the complex health situation. Examples of topics include the interaction between different body systems or the compensatory mechanisms that are activated in response to the health issue.
3. Physical Assessment Handout:
   * Highlight the key health (physical) assessment strategies and techniques relevant to identifying and managing the complex health situation. This may include how to interpret specific physical findings, the significance of various clinical signs, or the best practices in patient assessment for this condition.

### Task:

Pharmacology Handout:Develop a handout that details a specific drug or set of drugs used in managing the complex health situation you chose in Week 5. For each drug, include the following:

* Mechanism of action
* Indications for use
* Dosage and administration
* Potential side effects and contraindications
* Drug interactions
* Nursing considerations and patient education tips

Pathophysiology Handout:Create a handout that thoroughly explains the underlying pathophysiological processes of the complex health situation. Discuss how different body systems are involved, what compensatory mechanisms are activated, and how these mechanisms influence the progression of the disease. Visual aids such as flowcharts or diagrams may be included to illustrate these processes.

Physical Assessment Handout:Design a handout that outlines the critical aspects of the health (physical) assessment related to the complex health situation. This should include:

* Key physical examination techniques
* Interpretation of findings
* The significance of specific signs and symptoms
* Best practices for monitoring the patient’s condition
* Tools and equipment that may be required

Final Submission:Compile the three handouts, ensuring that they are clear, informative, and visually appealing. Each handout should be well-organized and provide valuable information that nursing students or staff nurses can easily reference in a clinical setting. Make sure to include citations for any references used and adhere to the latest clinical guidelines.

Grading:Your assignment will be evaluated based on the accuracy and depth of content, the clarity and organization of the handouts, the relevance of visual aids, and adherence to current clinical guidelines. Ensure that your handouts are well-researched, effectively communicate the intended information, and are useful as educational tools for the target audience.
