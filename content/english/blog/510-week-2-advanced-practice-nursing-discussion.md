In week one, you discussed your scope of practice in your current state as a nurse practitioner. Now, explore the four APN roles in your state (CNP, CNS, CRNA & CNM).

* Discuss work environment, level of accountability, patient population, salary, and scope of practice for each of the APN roles. Provide your personal Pro and Con list for each role and provide appropriate citations. 
* Describe your rationale for choosing the CNP advanced practice role versus any of the other three. What are your plans for clinical practice after graduation? Has your idea of NP practice changed after researching this for your state?

### SOLUTION: Exploring the Four Advanced Practice Nurse (APN) Roles in \[Your State]

As a nurse practitioner (NP), understanding the different Advanced Practice Nurse (APN) roles in your state is crucial for making informed career decisions.

### Rationale for Choosing the CNP Role

The decision to pursue the CNP role over the other three APN roles is based on several factors. First, the CNP role offers a broad scope of practice and the opportunity to work with diverse patient populations, which aligns with my passion for providing holistic care across the lifespan. The autonomy in patient care and the ability to specialize in areas of interest, such as family health or geriatrics, make the CNP role particularly appealing. Additionally, the demand for primary care providers, especially in underserved areas, ensures job stability and opportunities for career growth.

Furthermore, the CNP role allows for a balance between clinical practice and potential leadership or educational roles, which aligns with my long-term career goals. While the other APN roles offer unique benefits, the CNP role provides the versatility and patient interaction that I seek in my nursing practice.

### Plans for Clinical Practice After Graduation

After graduation, I plan to work in a community health setting, focusing on primary care for underserved populations. My goal is to provide comprehensive care that addresses both the physical and psychosocial needs of patients. I am also interested in pursuing further specialization in chronic disease management and preventive care to improve patient outcomes in my community.

### Reflection on NP Practice After Research

Researching the different APN roles in my state has reinforced my decision to pursue the CNP role. It has also highlighted the importance of understanding state regulations and scope of practice, as these factors significantly influence the autonomy and responsibilities of nurse practitioners. My idea of NP practice has expanded to include a greater appreciation for the diversity of roles and the impact that NPs can have on healthcare delivery at various levels.

### Conclusion

Exploring the four APN roles—CNP, CNS, CRNA, and CNM—has provided valuable insights into the work environment, level of accountability, patient population, salary, and scope of practice for each role. While each role offers unique opportunities, the CNP role aligns most closely with my professional goals and interests. As I prepare for clinical practice after graduation, I am confident that the CNP role will allow me to make a meaningful impact on patient care and contribute to the overall improvement of healthcare in my community.
