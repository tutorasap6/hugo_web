### NR 510 Week 5 Conflict at the Office Discussion

###### NR 510 Week 5

You are a family nurse practitioner working in an outpatient primary care office of a large hospital system. The practice has been operating for over 15 years, and many of the administrative and clinical staff were hired when the practice opened. You have been in the practice for less than 3 months. In that short amount of time, you have witnessed several of the clinical staff engaging in heated arguments with each other, sometimes in patient areas. You overhear an argument occurring today between two staff. You pick up a patient’s chart and notice a very low blood pressure that the medical assistant failed to notify you about. When you confront the MA, she states that she was going to report the vital signs to you when she became engaged in the heated argument you overheard and forgot to notify you.

Unfortunately, this pattern of behavior is not unusual in this practice. Working with staff who cannot cooperate effectively can negatively influence your ability to spend time with patients, can impede the flow of patients through the office, and could impact patient safety.

Discussion Question: What are the potential ethical and legal implications for each of the following practice members?:

* Medical assistants
* Nurse Practitioner
* Medical Director
* Practice

What strategies would you implement to prevent further episodes of potentially dangerous patient outcomes?

What leadership qualities would you apply to effect a positive change in the practice?  Be thinking about the culture of the practice. 

Provide rationales and evidence to support your decisions.

### SOLUTION: NR 510 Week 5 Conflict at the Office Discussion

#### Ethical and Legal Implications

1. Medical Assistants (MAs):
   * Ethical Implications: The medical assistant’s failure to notify the nurse practitioner about a critically low blood pressure reading due to being distracted by a heated argument presents a significant ethical concern. This lapse in duty compromises patient safety and violates the ethical principle of non-maleficence, which obliges healthcare professionals to avoid causing harm.
   * Legal Implications: If the patient were to suffer harm due to the missed vital sign, the MA could potentially face legal consequences for negligence. In a worst-case scenario, the healthcare facility could be held liable for malpractice if it is proven that this negligence directly resulted in patient harm.
2. Nurse Practitioner (NP):
   * Ethical Implications: As a nurse practitioner, it is essential to ensure that patient care is not compromised by internal conflicts within the team. The NP has a duty to address the toxic work environment that could impact patient care and to advocate for a professional and cooperative workplace. Ignoring these issues could lead to ethical breaches in patient care.
   * Legal Implications: While the primary legal responsibility may lie with the MA, the NP could also be implicated if it is demonstrated that there was a failure to supervise or address the ongoing conflicts, leading to compromised patient care.
3. Medical Director:
   * Ethical Implications: The medical director holds the ultimate responsibility for the operations of the practice. Ethically, they are accountable for ensuring a safe and effective working environment. Failing to address the ongoing conflicts and their impact on patient care violates the ethical principle of beneficence, which is to act in the best interest of the patients.
   * Legal Implications: The medical director could face legal challenges if it is determined that a lack of oversight and failure to address the hostile work environment contributed to patient harm or compromised care. The director’s inaction could be seen as negligence in their leadership role.
4. Practice:
   * Ethical Implications: The practice, as an entity, has an ethical responsibility to foster a safe and professional environment for both patients and staff. Failure to address ongoing conflicts that impact patient care breaches this responsibility and can lead to a decline in the quality of care provided.
   * Legal Implications: The practice could be subject to lawsuits if it is proven that the internal conflicts directly resulted in patient harm. The practice’s reputation could also suffer, leading to potential financial losses and a decrease in patient trust.

#### Strategies to Prevent Further Episodes

To prevent further episodes that could endanger patient outcomes, several strategies should be implemented:

1. Conflict Resolution Training: Implement regular training sessions focused on conflict resolution and effective communication among staff members. This training can equip staff with the skills to manage disagreements professionally without letting them interfere with patient care.
2. Clear Reporting Protocols: Establish and reinforce clear protocols for reporting critical patient information. All staff members should understand the importance of prioritizing patient care over personal disputes. Implementing a double-check system could also help ensure that critical information is communicated promptly.
3. Regular Team Meetings: Conduct regular team meetings to address any ongoing issues, provide a forum for open communication, and discuss the importance of maintaining a positive work environment. This can help in identifying potential problems before they escalate.
4. Anonymous Reporting Mechanism: Create a system where staff can report concerns about workplace behavior anonymously. This allows issues to be addressed before they affect patient care, without fear of retribution.

#### Leadership Qualities to Effect Positive Change

To foster a positive change in the practice, the following leadership qualities should be applied:

1. Emotional Intelligence: As a leader, demonstrating emotional intelligence is crucial. Understanding and managing one’s own emotions, as well as recognizing and influencing the emotions of others, can help de-escalate conflicts and build a more collaborative team environment.
2. Effective Communication: Clear and transparent communication is essential in addressing conflicts. A leader should encourage open dialogue, listen to concerns, and provide clear guidance on expected behaviors and protocols.
3. Accountability: Holding all staff members accountable for their actions is key to maintaining a professional environment. This includes addressing inappropriate behavior promptly and fairly, regardless of the staff member’s tenure or position.
4. Empathy: Showing empathy towards staff members can help in understanding the root causes of conflict and addressing them effectively. Empathy also helps in building trust and rapport among the team, leading to a more cohesive work environment.
5. Visionary Leadership: A leader should have a clear vision for the practice that prioritizes patient safety and a positive work culture. By consistently reinforcing this vision, the leader can guide the team towards achieving common goals, even in the face of challenges.

### Conclusion

Addressing the conflicts within the practice requires a multi-faceted approach that includes understanding the ethical and legal implications for all parties involved, implementing strategies to prevent future occurrences, and applying strong leadership qualities to effect positive change. By fostering a culture of cooperation, accountability, and patient-centered care, the practice can improve both the work environment and patient outcomes.
