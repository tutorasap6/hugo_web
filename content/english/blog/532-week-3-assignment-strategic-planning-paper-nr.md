The primary goal is to increase nurse retention rates from 55% back to at least 70% within the next 18 months. This goal supports the hospital's mission by ensuring that there is a stable and experienced nursing workforce capable of delivering high-quality and safe care to patients.

#### 3. Developing Action Plans

Communication with the nursing staff will be key, ensuring that they are aware of the changes and have opportunities to provide feedback throughout the implementation.

#### 5. Monitoring and Evaluation

To ensure the effectiveness of the strategic plan, regular monitoring and evaluation will be conducted. Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as retention rates, nurse satisfaction scores, and patient care quality metrics will be tracked monthly.
