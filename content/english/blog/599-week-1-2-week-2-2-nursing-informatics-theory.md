Question and answers 599 Week 1 2  Week 2 2 Nursing Informatics theory

1. Informatics is used by all members of the healthcare team in the daily care of patients. Nurses, for example, input data such as vital signs, intake and output measurements, and physical assessments. They also access critical information such as lab results and radiology reports through electronic health records (EHRs). This access helps the team better manage the patientâ€™s plan of care by ensuring that decisions are based on the most current and comprehensive data. Informatics allows healthcare professionals to provide patient-centered care that is efficient, well-organized, appropriate, and cost-effective by integrating evidence and technology.
2. Before completing the Pre-TANIC self-assessment, I considered myself to have a moderate level of competency in informatics. I felt comfortable using basic computer programs and navigating EPIC, our EHR system. However, after completing the self-assessment, I realized that my competency was higher than I initially thought. The specific questions in the assessment highlighted areas where I was more proficient or even expert, particularly in skills that I use regularly in my role as a clinical nurse manager. This experience boosted my confidence in my informatics skills and made me more aware of my strengths and areas for potential growth.
3. In my current role as a clinical nurse manager, I use two key informatics competencies:
   * Computer Literacy: I demonstrate computer literacy by effectively using various computer programs to access, audit, and analyze patient and unit-specific statistics. For example, I regularly run reports to monitor patient outcomes and identify trends that may require intervention, which is essential for ensuring high-quality care in my unit.
   * Clinical Information Management: I utilize clinical information management in both direct patient care and managerial responsibilities. In direct care, I use data such as lab results, monitor readings, and vital signs to communicate patient conditions to physicians and make informed care decisions. As a manager, I gather and analyze data that informs quality improvement projects and guides the education of my team members.
4. To enhance my informatics competencies, I have identified two valuable resources:
   * Fundamentals of Nursing Informatics Course (Nursing-informatics.com): This course offers comprehensive instruction on nursing informatics theory, practice applications, self-assessment, and skill development. It covers the use of computer technology in various aspects of healthcare, including clinical documentation, communication, care planning, education, and project management.
   * HI-FIVE: Health Informatics For Innovation, Value & Enrichment (Columbia University): This online course is designed for healthcare professionals and uses role-based case scenarios to address topics such as population health, care coordination, interoperability, value-based care, data analytics, and patient-centered care.
5. The identified resources are well-suited to my needs because they offer self-paced online formats that fit into my busy schedule. The courses are specifically designed to enhance nursing informatics skills in both clinical and management roles, which aligns with my professional development goals. They provide a comprehensive understanding of how informatics can be applied across various aspects of healthcare, making them ideal for improving my proficiency in nursing informatics.
6. To enact this improvement plan, I intend to enroll in the online courses mentioned and systematically apply the knowledge gained to my practice. By completing these courses, I will be better equipped to utilize nursing informatics in direct patient care, evaluate patient outcomes, and facilitate education for both patients and staff. The strategic use of these resources will enable me to enhance the quality of care provided and lead my team more effectively.
