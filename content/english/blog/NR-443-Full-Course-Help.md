NR 443 Week 3 Discussion 1 Collaborating With the CommunityIdentify a community or aggregate you are currently involved with at home (personal life) or at work. Cite some major value, major strengths, and health needs of your community or aggregate. How could a nurse work collaboratively with a community to build on these strengths and facilitate community empowerment? Keep in mind the different methods of community outreach the nurse could utilize.
NR 443 Week 3 Discussion 2 Resources
Assurance is one of the three core functions of public health. Knowing what resources are available is part of this function. Find a resource in your community that could be used as a referral source and share information about the services provided. Who is eligible for the services? What could be done in order to improve the accessibility, acceptability, affordability, or availability of this resource in your community? Make sure to address all four of the A's in your posting.

NR 443 Week 4 Discussion 1 Concerns for the School NurseAs the school nurse role continues to evolve, there are increasingly more health concerns for the school nurse. Does the locale make a difference in the problems, or are health problems in children and adolescents universal? In some inner-city areas, poor nutrition is a prevalent issue. What do you think are the biggest problems in your areas?
NR 443 Week 4 Discussion 2 Nurse's Role in Community Health SettingsWhen caring for populations in community settings, the nurse has many different roles, such as advocate, case manager, educator, researcher, administrator, and so on. Choose one of the community healthcare settings from your textbook or lessons and discuss how one of these roles might be carried out by the community health nurse in the setting you chose.

NR 443 Week 5 Discussion 1 Vulnerable PopulationsAs nurses, we all know what we should do to maintain a healthy lifestyle, but often knowledge does not translate into actual behavior. Vulnerable populations may face additional individual and/or societal barriers to being healthy. What are those barriers? What can nurses do to overcome some of the barriers that you identified?
NR 443 Week 5 Discussion 2 Priority Setting When Working With Vulnerable PopulationsThis week, we have discussed many different vulnerable populations. Choose a vulnerable population and discuss what you think the top three priorities are for a CHN working with them. Cite at least one scholarly reference that supports your decision.

NR 443 Week 6 Discussion 1 Environmental PollutantsVisit the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Envirofacts website at.............Enter your city, zip code, or location. Explore the site to learn more about your environment and things that might be impacting the health of its citizens. Identify something new you learned about your environment and how it could be affecting health by completing this statement, I didn’t know \_\_\_\_. How could you, in the role of a community health nurse, address these concerns?
NR 443 Week 6 Discussion 2 Disaster PreparednessVisit the website..............Review the steps for being prepared for a disaster. As a community health nurse, what elements do you think are important to stress to the community? How is your community preparing for a potential disaster, or how has it prepared?

NR 443 Week 7 Discussion 1 How Do You Define HealthThink about how you define health. Do you think your definition is universal, or is it specific to your culture and/or beliefs? How might another culture's definition differ?
NR 443 Week 7 Discussion 2 Affordable HealthcarePlease explore the website...........Choose the Get Answers tab towards the top of the page. Please review several of the topics under this tab and share something that you learned about how the Marketplace works and how this would apply to those in your community. The Affordable Care Act is a controversial topic and I’m sure there are many different viewpoints represented in our class. For this discussion, let’s focus on understanding the basics of the Marketplace so that we can provide accurate information for our patients and communities.
