Capstone Course (Chamberlain University)

**1.A nurse is caring for a client who has atopic dermatitis and a prescription for triamcinolone ointment. The nurse
should assess the client to monitor for which of the following adverse effects?**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thinning of the skin delayed healing

###### **MY ANSWER**

Thinning of the skin and delayed healing are
adverse effects of topical glucocorticoid preparations. The client should only apply the ointment to dry patches of the
skin because topical steroids can cause atrophy of the dermis and epidermis,
which can result in thinning of the skin.

**2. A nurse is assessing a client who has left-sided heart failure. Which of the following findings should the nurse identify as a manifestation of
left-sided heart failure? Frothy sputum**
-----------------------------------------

**MY ANSWER**

The nurse should identify that frothy sputum,
dyspnea, and wheezing are manifestations of left-sided heart failure. Treatment includes fluid restriction and diuretics to decrease preload and reduce pulmonary congestion. Pink-tinged frothy sputum can be an
early indication of pulmonary edema and can be life-threatening. Therefore, the
nurse should notify the provider immediately.

## **3. A nurse is caring for a client who is experiencing anxiety as well as numbness and tingling of the lips and fingers. The client's ABGs are: pH 7.48, PCO230 mm Hg, HCO3- 24 mEq/L, PaO2 85 mm Hg. Which of the following acid-base imbalances should the nurse identify that the client is experiencing?**

**MA nurse is assessing a client who has Cushing's syndrome. Which of the following findings should the nurse
expect?**

Osteoporosis

Osteoporosis is a common finding with Cushing's
syndrome. Bones become thinner as a result of mineral loss and nitrogen
depletion, and the risk for fractures increases.

**4. A nurse is inspecting the skin of a client who has basal cell carcinoma. The nurse should identify which of the following lesion characteristics on the
client's skin?**
----------------

MY ANSWER

A client who has basal cell carcinoma has a
nodular lesion with welldefined borders and a pearly or waxy appearance,
resulting from overexposure to the sun, especially on the face, head, and neck.

**5. A nurse is assessing a client who has hypocalcemia. In which of the following
areas should the nurse tap on the client's face to detect the presence of Chvostek's sign? (You will find hot spots to select in the artwork below.
Select only the hot spot that corresponds to your answer).**
------------------------------------------------------------

A is correct. The nurse should tap the client's cheek just in
front of the ear and below the zygomatic arch. The client
who has hypocalcemia will display a Chvostek's sign, which is a twitching of
the facial muscle.

**6. A nurse in an emergency department is assessing a client who is overusing
prescribed diuretics and has a sodium level of 127 mEq/L. Which of the
following laboratory findings should the**
------------------------------------------

MY ANSWER

A client who has hyponatremia as a result of diuretic overuse has
a low urine specific gravity. The increased excretion of water alters the ratio
of particulate matter, which affects the specific gravity.

\*\*A home health nurse is assisting a client with planning care for a
family member who has Alzheimer's disease. Which of the following instructions
should the nurse include? \*\*

*Remove clutter from rooms and hallways.*

The nurse should instruct the family member to remove clutter from
rooms and hallways so the client is able to walk without the risk of falling or
tripping over objects. Later in the disease, the client can experience seizures, so cluttered areas could be
a risk to the client.

A nurse is caring for a client who has developed acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS).

**7. Which of the following findings should the nurse identify as a manifestation of this
syndrome?**
-----------

Refractory hypoxemia

**MY ANSWER**

ARDS is a systemic inflammatory response to trauma, sepsis, burns, pancreatitis, and
blood transfusions, when excess lung fluid dilutes surfactant activity in the
lungs. A client who has ARDS has refractory hypoxemia, which is hypoxemia that
does not improve with oxygen therapy. Extensive
pulmonary edema evident on a chest x-ray is a manifestation of ARDS.

**8. An emergency room nurse is assessing a client who has asthma and difficulty
breathing. Which of the following findings should indicate to the nurse that
the client is experiencing status asthmaticus?**
------------------------------------------------

Use of accessory muscles

###### **MY ANSWER**

A client who has status asthmaticus uses accessory muscles to help
facilitate breathing, which is a manifestation of a severe airflow obstruction.
The situation is life-threatening and the nurse should intervene immediately
with strong systemic bronchodilators, epinephrine, corticosteroids, and oxygen.

**9. A nurse is teaching a client who has a new prescription for phenytoin to treat a
seizure disorder. Which of the following adverse effects should the nurse
instruct the client to report immediately to the provider?**
------------------------------------------------------------

###### **MY ANSWER**

When using the urgent vs. nonurgent approach to client care, the nurse
should determine that the priority finding is a rash, which can have a
measles-like appearance and progress to exfoliative dermatitis or
Stevens-Johnson syndrome. The client should report this finding
to the provider immediately.

\*\*A nurse is monitoring a client following a lumbar laminectomy. The
client has a drain and indwelling urinary catheter. The nurse should identify
which of the following findings as an indication of a complication of the
surgery? \*\*

**Clear drainage on the dressings**

The nurse should identify clear drainage on or
around the dressing as an indication of a cerebral spinal leak and should
report this finding to the provider immediately.

## **10. A nurse is assessing a client who has right-sided heart failure.Which of the following findings should the nurse identify as a manifestation of right-sided heart failure?**

Increased abdominal girth

**MY ANSWER**

Increased abdominal girth is an expected finding
with right-sided heart failure due to systemic congestion and an enlarged liver
and spleen. Systemic congestion can lead to fluid retention and increased
pressure in the venous system, which can manifest with edema in the lower
extremities.

## **11. A nurse is caring for a client who recently assumed the role of caregiver for their aging parents who have chronic illnesses. The nurse should identify that which of the following statements by the client indicates acceptance of the role change?**

The client is becoming flushed.

**MY ANSWER**

Flushing is a manifestation of an infusion reaction to
vancomycin that also causes a rash on the face and upper body, called red man
syndrome. Red man syndrome results from infusing vancomycin too rapidly. The
nurse

should infuse the medication
over at least 60 min. -

The client can have an adverse effect called red man syndrome, which
causes hypotension and tachycardia,
due to infusing the vancomycin too rapidly

**13. A nurse is caring for a male client who has a new prescription for cyclosporine
following a kidney transplant. Which of the following findings should the nurse
identify as an adverse effect of this therapy? **
-------------------------------------------------

BUN 24 mg/dL

MY ANSWER

A BUN of 24 mg/dL is above the expected reference range of 10 to
20 mg/dL, indicating renal impairment. An adverse effect of cyclosporine is
nephrotoxicity. The nurse should monitor the client for increases in BUN and
creatinine and report any elevation to the provider. A rise in BUN could
indicate transplant rejection.

**14. A nurse is caring for a client who has dumping syndrome following a gastric
resection. The nurse should monitor the client for which of the following
complications of dumping syndrome? **
-------------------------------------

Iron-deficiency anemia

**MY ANSWER**

The nurse should monitor the client for manifestations of anemia,
such as pallor, tachycardia, and fatigue. Rapid emptying of the stomach
contents into the intestine can lead to reduced absorption of iron in the
duodenum, causing iron-deficiency anemia.

**15. A nurse is assessing a client who takes salmeterol to treat
moderate asthma. Which of the following findings should indicate to the nurse
that the medication has been effective?**
-----------------------------------------

The client's daily peak expiratory flow (PEF)
measures 85% above personal best.

A client who has asthma should use a peak flow meter twice daily
to monitor asthma control. A PEF in the green zone, or 80% or above personal
best, indicates the effectiveness of medication therapy.

## **16. A nurse is providing teaching about health promotion activities for a client who has a new diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Which of the following statements by the client indicates an understanding of the teaching?**

"I will check my blood sugar level before
exercising."

MY ANSWER

Clients who have diabetes mellitus should not exercise if their
blood glucose level is less than 80 mg/dL or greater than 250 mg/dL. A client
who has type 1 diabetes mellitus and is hyperglycemic can experience even
higher blood glucose levels. Hypoglycemia can also occur during exercise and up
to 24 hr following exercise. The nurse should instruct the client to monitor
blood glucose levels before, during, and following exercise.

**17. A nurse is providing teaching to a client who has a new
prescription for warfarin. Which of the following medications should the nurse
instruct the client to avoid? (Select all that apply.) Ferrous sulfate**
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**18. A nurse is assisting with the care of a client who is scheduled
for a thoracentesis. Which of the following interventions should the nurse plan
to take?**
----------

Place the client leaning forward over the
bedside table for the procedure.

**MY ANSWER**

The nurse should place the client leaning forward over the bedside
table for a thoracentesis. This allows the provider complete access to the
client's chest and back. This position also expands the spaces between the ribs
where the pleural fluid accumulates.

## **19. A nurse is providing discharge teaching about infection control at home for a client who has tuberculosis. Which of the following statements by the client indicates an understanding of the teaching?**

"I will place my used tissues in a plastic
bag."

the teaching?**
---------------

A PCA pump will be used for postoperative pain
control.

**MY ANSWER**

A PCA pump is a common method of pain management in the first 24
hr following an open radical prostatectomy. The nurse should teach the client
how to manage pain during the preoperative period rather than waiting until
after surgery when the client is feeling the sedative effects of the anesthesia
and pain medication.

## **22. A nurse is assessing a client's ECG strip and notes an irregular heart rate of 98/min with no clear P waves. Which of the following cardiac dysrhythmias should the nurse document?**

**MY ANSWER**

With atrial fibrillation, multiple rapid impulses from many
different foci cause depolarization of the atria in a rapid, disorganized
manner. This causes a chaotic rhythm on the ECG strip that has no clear P
waves, no atrial contractions, and an irregular rhythm.

**23. A nurse is caring for a client who is receiving peritoneal
dialysis. Which of the following actions should the nurse take?**
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Report cloudy dialysate drainage to the
provider.

**MY ANSWER**

The most serious complication of peritoneal dialysis is peritonitis, an
inflammation of the peritoneum. Assessment findings include cloudy dialysate
drainage, rebound abdominal tenderness, and diffuse abdominal pain. The nurse
should report these findings immediately to the provider, who can then
prescribe a fluid culture, quick exchanges to wash out mediators of infection,
and antibiotics.

**24. A nurse is assessing a client who has suspected appendicitis. Which of the following manifestations should the nurse expect? (Select all that
apply.)**
---------

a)Elevated WBC count

b)Elevated amylase level

c) Rebound tenderness

d) Ascites

e) Anorexia

**MY ANSWER**

Elevated WBC count is correct.A client who has acute appendicitis will show a moderate elevation of the WBC
count from 10,000 to 18,000/mm3. If the WBC
count is greater than 20,000/mm3, it can
indicate a perforated appendix.

Rebound tenderness is correct.A client who has appendicitis develops localized pain over the right lower
quadrant of the abdomen. When the area is palpated, pain occurs during release
of pressure on the client's abdomen.

**Anorexia is correct.** A client who has acute appendicitis experiences nausea, vomiting, and reduced
appetite.

## **25. A nurse is planning preventative strategies for a client who is at risk for pressure injuries. Which of the following actions should the nurse include in the plan? Apply moisturizer to damp skin after bathing.**

**MY ANSWER**

the urine are an indicator of inadequate amounts of insulin and high blood
glucose levels.

A nurse is caring for a client who had a surgical repair of an abdominal aortic
aneurysm 3 days ago. The client's vital signs are: temperature 38.3° C (100.9°
F), heart rate 80/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 128/76 mm Hg.
Which of the following actions is the nurse's priority?

Assess the surgical incision for signs of
infection.

**MY ANSWER**

A surgical wound infection typically appears 3 to 6 days following
the surgery. Fever from the third postoperative day onward indicates that this
client's greatest risk is either a wound infection or a pulmonary infection;
therefore, this is the priority action the nurse should take.

## **27. A nurse is providing discharge teaching to a client following a loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) for the treatment of cervical cancer. Which of the following statements by the client indicates an understanding of the teaching?**

the medication regimen.

## **30. A nurse is caring for a client who has acute kidney injury and a potassium level of 6.5 mEq/L. Which of the following ECG changes should the nurse expect?**

Peaked T waves

Elevated potassium levels result in tall, peaked T waves, flat or
absent P waves, prolonged PR intervals, wide QRS complexes, and ectopic beats.
Hyperkalemia can progress to complete heart block, ventricular fibrillation,
and asystole.

A nurse is caring for a client who had abdominal surgery. The client tells the
nurse that "something gave way." The nurse removes the dressing and
sees the wound has eviscerated. Identify the correct sequence of steps the
nurse should follow. (Move the steps into the box on the right, placing them in

have underlying diseases that compromise their immune response have an
increased risk for UTIs.

## **33. A nurse is preparing to discharge a client who is postoperative following a total hip arthroplasty. Which of the following equipment should the nurse ensure that the client has available at home prior to discharge?**

Elevated toilet seat

**MY ANSWER**

A client who is postoperative following a total hip arthroplasty
is at risk for dislocation of the hip prosthesis. Limitations on hip flexion
and adduction decrease the risk. The client should avoid flexing the hip
greater than 90° and should avoid using toilet seats that are low to the
ground. An elevated toilet seat should be in place in the client's home prior
to the client's discharge.

\*\*A nurse is assessing a client who has a history of type 2 diabetes
mellitus. The nurse should identify which of the following findings as an
indication of a microvascular complication? \*\*

foods. Clients who have dementia can have difficulty sitting still and tend to
wander, which makes weight loss and malnutrition a concern. Therefore, foods
that the client can hold while ambulating are ideal.

## **49. A nurse is completing an admission assessment for a client who has bacterial meningitis. Which of the following personal protective equipment should the nurse use while caring for the client?**

Surgical mask

**MY ANSWER**

The nurse should adhere to droplet precautions in addition to
standard precautions for clients who have bacterial meningitis, provided the
causative pathogen spreads via droplets. Examples of pathogens that spread via
droplets include Haemophilus influenzaeand Neisseria meningitidis. The nurse
should place these clients in a private room and wear a mask when within 0.9 m
(3 feet) of the client to prevent acquiring the infection. Clients should wear
a mask whenever they are outside their room. These precautions are essential
until 24 hr after the initiation of antibiotic therapy.

**50. A nurse is assessing a client for fluid volume deficit following lumbar spinal surgery. The nurse should identify which of the following
findings as an indication the client is at risk for fluid volume deficit?**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Surgical drain output 300 mL during an 8-hr
shift

MY ANSWER

A client who had lumbar spinal surgery should not have more than 250 mL from a
drain in the first 24 hr. Therefore, 300 mL in 8 hr can indicate that the
client is at risk for fluid volume deficit.

**51. A nurse is assessing a client who has a central venous catheter (CVC) with intravenous (IV) fluids infusing. The client suddenly develops shortness of breath, and the nurse notes that the IV tubing and needleless connector device are disconnected. Which of the following actions should the
nurse take first?**
-------------------

Close the pinch clamp on the CVC.

**MY ANSWER**

The greatest risk to this client is air embolism resulting from accidental
disconnection of the CVC tubing. Therefore, the priority action is to clamp the
catheter immediately by closing the pinch clamp to prevent any further air from
entering the system. When an air embolism occurs, air enters through the
central vein into the right ventricle and lodges by the pulmonary valve,
decreasing the amount of blood that is able to enter into the ventricle and the
pulmonary arteries.

**52. A nurse is planning care for a client who is scheduled for surgery and has a latex allergy. Which of the following actions should the nurse plan
to take?**
----------

Place monitoring cords and tubes in a
stockinette.

**MY ANSWER**

prevent direct contact with the client's skin.

A nurse is providing preoperative teaching about stool consistency
to a client who will undergo a colectomy with the placement of an ileostomy.
Which of the following information about stool consistency should the nurse
include in the teaching?

The stool will have a high volume of liquid.

**MY ANSWER**

The nurse should include in the teaching that when peristalsis
returns, the client can have an initial period of high-volume liquid stool
output, more than 1,000 mL/day. Later, as the proximal small bowel adapts,
stool volume should decrease.

## **53. A nurse is providing teaching to a client who has a new prescription for levothyroxine to treat hypothyroidism. Which of the following statements by the client indicates an understanding of the teaching?**

"If my heart starts racing, my provider
might need to adjust my dosage."

**MY ANSWER**

Levothyroxine increases metabolism, which can increase oxygen
consumption and heart rate. If the client's heart is racing, the dosage might
be too high, causing thyrotoxicosis with manifestations of tachycardia,
insomnia, tremors and nervousness, hyperthermia, heat intolerance, and
sweating. The provider should retest the client's thyroid hormone levels and
adjust the dosage accordingly.

**54. A nurse is assessing a client who has an exacerbation of
diverticular disease. In which of the following quadrants should the nurse anticipate the client to be experiencing abdominal pain?**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Left lower quadrant

Diverticula commonly develop in the sigmoid colon because of the
high pressure it takes to move stool into the rectum. Therefore, the pain with
