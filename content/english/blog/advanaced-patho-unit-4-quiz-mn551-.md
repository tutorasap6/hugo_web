### Question 1:

A 44-year-old woman developed calf pain during a transatlantic flight followed by acute shortness of breath upon arrival at her destination. She was subsequently diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism (PE), which resolved with anticoagulant therapy. Which of the following statements best characterizes the underlying problem of her PE?

Answer Options:

1. The patient experienced shortness of breath because ventilation was occurring but perfusion was inadequate.
2. Restoration of normal perfusion but compromised ventilation caused hypoxia.
3. The patient developed a transient anatomic shunt resulting in impaired oxygenation.
4. Decreased diffusion across alveolar membranes resulted in dyspnea and hypoxia.

Correct Answer:

1. The patient experienced shortness of breath because ventilation was occurring but perfusion was inadequate.

Answer Options:

1. Hyponatremia due to dehydration
2. Legionnaires' disease
