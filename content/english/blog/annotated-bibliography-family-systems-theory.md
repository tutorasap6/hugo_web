Annotated Bibliography: Family Systems Theory

Family Systems Theory (FST) is a theoretical perspective that views the family as an emotional unit and employs systems thinking to describe the complex interactions within it. This theory posits that individuals cannot be understood in isolation from one another but rather as part of their family, as the family is an emotional unit. The following annotated bibliography explores the application of Family Systems Theory across various domains of nursing practice, emphasizing its relevance and impact.

### Sense of Support within the Family

Milberg, A., Liljeroos, M., Wåhlberg, R., & Krevers, B. (2020). Sense of support within the family: A cross-sectional study of family members in palliative home care. BMC Palliative Care, 19(1), 120. [https://doi.org/10.1186/s12904-020-00623-z](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12904-020-00623-z)

This study utilized a cross-sectional design to evaluate the sense of support within families providing palliative home care. By interviewing 209 adult family members, the researchers identified factors contributing to the perceived support and developed a model to enhance family support in palliative settings. The findings underscore the importance of the family unit in providing emotional and practical support to palliative care patients. The study's results are crucial for nurse practitioners, as they highlight the need for involving family members in care plans to improve patient outcomes.

### Family Functioning and Childhood Obesity Treatment

Pratt, K., & Skelton, J. (2018). Family functioning and childhood obesity treatment: A Family Systems Theory-informed approach. Academic Pediatrics, 18(6), 620–627. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acap.2018.04.001](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acap.2018.04.001)

This article explores the application of Family Systems Theory to address childhood obesity. By focusing on family-centered care and interventions, the study demonstrates how familial support and education can effectively manage and prevent childhood obesity. The findings highlight the significance of involving families in treatment plans and stress the role of education in promoting healthier lifestyle choices. For nurse practitioners, this approach emphasizes the need to develop comprehensive care plans that include family education and support to enhance health outcomes.

### Family Relationships and Depressive Symptoms

Ren, Z., Zhou, G., Wang, Q., Xiong, W., Ma, J., He, M., Shen, Y., Fan, X., Guo, X., Gong, P., Liu, M., Yang, X., Liu, H., & Zhang, X. (2019). Associations of family relationships and negative life events with depressive symptoms among Chinese adolescents: A cross-sectional study. PLoS ONE, 14(7), e0219939. [https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0219939](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0219939)

This cross-sectional study examines the correlation between family relationships, negative life events, and depressive symptoms among Chinese adolescents. By analyzing responses from 3,081 middle school students, the researchers found that poor family relationships significantly increased the risk of depressive symptoms. The study underscores the importance of strong family support systems in mitigating the effects of negative life events. Nurse practitioners can use these insights to screen for mental health issues and involve families in the treatment process to provide comprehensive care.

### Positive Psychology Interventions and Family Happiness

Waters, L. (2020). Using positive psychology interventions to strengthen family happiness: A Family Systems Approach. The Journal of Positive Psychology, 15(5), 645-652. https\://doi.org/10.1080/17439760.2020.1789704

This study assessed the impact of positive psychology interventions on family happiness using a Family Systems Approach. By conducting a randomized, wait-list controlled study with 300 families, the researchers found that positive practice and supportive environments significantly enhanced family happiness. The study highlights the role of environmental factors in family well-being and the importance of positive interventions. For nurse practitioners, these findings suggest the need to consider environmental and psychological factors in care plans to promote overall family health.

### Autism Spectrum Disorder and Sibling Relationships

Wright, B., & Benigno, J. (2019). Autism spectrum disorder and sibling relationships: Exploring implications for intervention using a Family Systems Framework. American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology, 28(2), 759–767. [https://doi.org/10.1044/2018\_AJSLP-18-0088](https://doi.org/10.1044/2018_AJSLP-18-0088)

This article investigates the relationship between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and sibling relationships, utilizing a Family Systems Framework. The study highlights the positive impact of sibling involvement in speech-language pathology interventions for children with ASD. The findings emphasize the importance of family involvement in the treatment and management of ASD. For nurse practitioners, incorporating family members, particularly siblings, in care plans can enhance the effectiveness of interventions and support the child's development.

### Conclusion

Family Systems Theory provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and addressing various health issues within the family unit. By emphasizing the interconnectedness of family members, this theory highlights the importance of involving families in care plans to improve patient outcomes. The studies reviewed in this annotated bibliography demonstrate the practical applications of Family Systems Theory in palliative care, childhood obesity treatment, mental health, family happiness, and ASD management. For nurse practitioners, integrating this theory into practice can enhance the quality of care and support provided to patients and their families.
