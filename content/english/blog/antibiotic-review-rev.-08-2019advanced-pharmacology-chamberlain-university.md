ANTIBIOTIC REVIEWNRHS Infectious Disease Primer

SECTION 1: INHIBITORS OF CELL WALL SYNTHESIS

Penicillins:

* Introduced in 1941 for the treatment of G(+) infections (staph/strep)
* Newer forms developed secondary to resistance and need for G(-) coverage
* Time-dependent (troughs more important than peaks for efficacy)
* Penicillin-binding proteins (PBP’s) are enzymes involved in cell wall synthesis in bacterial membrane that bind beta-lactams. PBP modification is a mechanism for resistance
* Newer drugs and combos considered broad spectrum
* Generally short half-life (frequent dosing)
* Specific agents
  * Natural – Pen G (IV), Pen VK (oral)
    * Primarily Strep and oral anaerobes (think dentist office), syphilis DOC
  * Penicillinase-resistant – nafcillin, methicillin, oxacillin, dicloxacillin
    * Developed for emerging resistance to PCN
    * Anti-staph agents, strep coverage not as good
  * Aminopenicillins – amoxicillin, ampicillin
    * Enhanced G(-) coverage (esp. H. flu)
  * Anti-pseudomonal penicillins – piperacillin
    * Degraded by β-lactamase
    * Does NOT typically cover VRE
  * β-lactamase inhibitor combos – Augmentin (amoxicillin/clavulanate), Unasyn (ampicillin/sulbactam), Zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam)
    * Irreversible inhibitors of β-lactamase
    * Recovers Staph coverage
    * Recovers anaerobic coverage

Carbapenems:

* Primaxin (imipenem/cilastatin), Merrem (meropenem), Invanz (ertapenem), doripenem?
* “Gorillacillin” – G(+), G(-), and anaerobes including Pseudomonas (except ertapenem)
* Generally β-lactamase resistant
* Time-dependent
* Seizures significant with imipenem; caution with others (inclusion bias)
* Meropenem/vaborbactam (Vabomere) – MDR including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae

Monobactam:

* Azacatam (aztreonam)
* G(-) coverage only; Pseudomonal coverage
* No anaerobic coverage
* No cross-sensitivity with PCNs

Cephalosporins:

* Time-dependent

    * IV: cefuroxime, cefoxitin, cefotetan
    * Adds H. flu, Enterobacter, and Neisseria (HENPEcK)
    * Cefoxitin, cefotetan = anaerobic coverage (cefoxitin has no oxygen)
    * Cefuroxime should be given with food to avoid degradation by esterases
  * Third generation
    * PO: Suprax (cefixime), Vantin (cefpodoxime), Omnicef (cefdinir)
    * IV: cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime

    * Rocephin (ceftriaxone)
      * Long half-life (q24h dosing)
      * Excreted in bile, so no renal dose adjustments
      * “Good” CNS penetration – DOSE q12h in meningitis
      * Displaces bilirubin – caution in neonates
    * Fortaz (ceftazidime) = (+) Pseudomonas coverage
  * Fourth generation – Maxipime (cefepime)
    * G(+) and G(-) coverage
    * Pseudomonas coverage
    * Used in febrile neutropenia and as alternative to Zosyn in sepsis for PCN-allergic patients
  * “Fifth generation” – Teflaro (ceftaroline)
    * Indicated for CAP and ABSSSI
    * Gram (-) – E. coli, Klebsiella, H. flu
    * No Pseudomonal coverage
    * Not indicated for MRSA pneumonia or bacteremia, but can be seen in combination with vancomycin for persistent infections
