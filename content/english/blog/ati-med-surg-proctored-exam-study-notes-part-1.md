9.    Post mastectomy:
Avoid Talc powder/deodorant until incision is healed, perform ROM on affected
arm, exercise arm by walking it up a wall as high as possible, elevate effected
arm on pillow while resting in bed

10. Postop patient in skeletal traction should expect: Redness and warmth at the pin
sites

11. Lupuspatients should take ibuprofen for joint pain, use sunblock of spf of 30 or
greater to reduce exacerbations of symptoms, and slight fever elevations can be
an indicator of an exacerbation

12. Hypoparathyroidism– involuntary muscle spasms are an indication, because of calcium deficiency

13. Pacemaker– a patient with a new pacemaker should check their heart rate every day, do
not raise arms until released to do so as it may dislodge the pacemaker, and it
is SAFE to use a microwave

14. Emphysema– patients should use pursed lip breathing during periods of dyspnea, drink
2,000-3,000 mL of fluids daily to keep secretions thin and easier to
expectorate

15. Multiple
Sclerosis – acute episodes are usually followed by remissions, which can
least varying lengths of time

16. Hyperglycemia– expectations you would see: Kussmaul respirations, decreased skin turgor,
fruity breath odor, dry mouth, extreme thirst, and ketonuria

17. Hypoglycemia– expectations you would see: diaphoresis, weakness, hunger, nausea, shakiness,
and confusion

18. Colostomy– There are no food restrictions unless the client chooses so because of food
odors and increased gas, the colostomy should begin to function 2-6 days after
surgery, normal/intact/formed stool can be expected.

19. Skull
fracture – indication would be clear fluid coming from the nares or ears
after head injury, and should be identified as cerebrospinal fluid

20. Concussion– indications include: headache and brief change in level of consciousness

21. Hepatitis
A – spread through fecal/oral contamination

22. Hepatitis
B and C – spread through blood and sexual contact

patients taking isoniazid – should NOT drink alcohol, therapy lasts between
6 and 9 months, take med on empty stomach, your liver function will need to be
monitored while taking to avoid hepatotoxicity

24. TB
patient taking rifampin – expected harmless effect of medication is
red/orange discoloration of urine

25. Flexion
contracture – a bent flexed joint that cannot be straightened actively or
passively, usually caused by immobilization

26. Drainage
tubes – always place them lower so the drainage doesn’t back up and gravity
helps them drain fluids

27. Thrombocytopenia– Patients are at risk for bleeding so avoid any invasive procedures such as IM
injections, and instruct patients to avoid flossing due to risk of bleeding at
the gums

28. Low
cholesterol diet – examples include: Chicken breast and all vegetables

29. Cancer
tumors – are typically hard, fixed, irregular in shape, and nontender to
palpation

30. Fibrocystic
breast disease – indicated by multiple masses of regular shape, lumps are
moveable and increase in tenderness during the menstrual period 

31. Sickle
Cell – promote rest (activity causes discomfort), keep client warm, oxygen
should be administered as hypoxia increases sickling and client discomfort.

32. Herpes
Zoster – is contagious to people who have never had chickenpox and is most
contagious while fluid-filled blisters are present on the skin

33. Dialysis- Weigh the client before and after each treatment, sterile gloves w/ strict
aseptic technique should be used when handling bags of dialysate fluid,
dialysate fluid should be kept at room temp

34. Blepharitis– inflammation of eyelids

35. Epistaxis– nosebleed, to control pinch the soft portion of the nose for 10 minutes

36. Radiation Therapy – patients should be kept in a
private room, staff entering client’s room should don a lead apron, dislodged
implants should be picked up with forceps and placed in a lead container to
prevent exposure.

37. Gout– to prevent uric acid stones, take allopurinol as prescribed, exercise several
times a week, avoid foods high in purine such as organ meats, poultry, fish,
red wine, and gravies. Increase fluid intake of 2-3 L per day. Citrus juices
help alkalinize the urine which helps prevent uric acid stone formation

38. Gout
medications – Colchicine for acute gout
attack and Allopurinol for chronic gout andPegloticase is IV med to treat chronic gout
that has not responded to normal treatments

39. Encephalitis
due to West Nile virus – expected findings: Stiff neck, photophobia,
lethargy

40. Transfusions– Document vital signs, use 20 gauge or larger, verify blood type/Rh and check
with 2 nurses, provide RN with IV tubing that has a filter, use only normal
saline

41. AIDS– use standard precautions when caring for a client that has AIDS

42. AIDS –
use bleach/water solution of 1:10 to clean bathroom surfaces for adequate
disinfection

43. Stomatitis– inflamed and sore mouth, interventions include: use soft toothbrush or foam
swab for oral care, avoid alcohol based mouthwash, use a straw when drinking
liquids to bypass areas and increase irritation, rinse mouth frequently with
hydrogen peroxide, warm saline, or baking soda solution

44. Fat
emboli – typically occur 12 to 48 hr. after injury when fat droplets from
the marrow enter into the systemic circulation and are deposited into the
lungs. This should be reported immediately, it could progress into acute
respiratory failure

45. Thrombophlebitis– apply compression stockings on lower extremities to promote blood return and
decrease venous stasis

46. Following hip
arthroplasty, place an abduction pillow on the client to prevent
dislocation of the new hip joint during position changes

47. EEG –
prior to EEG instruct client to eat regularly to avoid low blood glucose, avoid
sedatives and anticonvulsants before procedures because is depresses CNS
function and that can alter test results

48. Endocarditis– which is inflammation inside the chambers of the heart, and patients should
notify provider before dental procedures due to the need for prophylactic
antibiotic therapy to reduce the risk of strep infection

49. Timolol
eye drops – instill into the conjunctival sac and apply pressure to the
bridge of the nose for 1 minute afterwards to prevent systemic absorption of
the medication (AKA lacrimal duct)

50. Seizures– if a client is experiencing a seizure while sitting in a chair, lower the
client to the floor to avoid injury

51. Following
above the knee amputation – assist the client to prone position for 20-30
minutes every 3-4 hours following an amputation to reduce the risk of flexion
contractures

52. Hx of
unstable angina – expected finding would be chest pain when at rest

53. Client should sit upright for 30 minutes after taking medication to prevent
esophageal irritation and ulceration

54. Pyelonephritis– is a bacterial infection of the kidney and renal pelvis. Reinforce wiping
from front to back to avoid introducing bacteria into the urinary tract which
can ultimately cause pyelonephritis

sign – facial spasm most likely caused by low calcium

57. Trousseau
sign – spasm of feet or hands, likely caused by low calcium
(hyperventilation induced hypocalcemia)

58. Right sided heart
failure would most likely result in dependent edema from subsequent
systemic venous back up

59. ALS-sign would be weakness of the distal extremities

60. Myasthenia Gravis – autoimmune disorder that
destroy the communication between nerves and muscle, results in weakness of
skeletal muscles, mostly affects voluntary muscles that control eyes, nose,
throat, and limbs

61. Buck’s Traction – Inspect skin every 8 hours,
encourage client to perform dorsiflexion of affected extremity every 2 hours,
never release traction as this can increase the client’s muscle spasms

62. Airway
obstruction – signs include flaring nares, intercostal retractions,
restlessness, tachycardia, tachypnea

63. Guillain-Barre’
syndrome – rare autoimmune disorder which a person’s own immune system
damages the nerves causing muscle weakness and sometime paralysis. Lasts a few
weeks to years. Can fully recover

64. Prednisone – patient’s taking this medication
are more susceptible to infection

by plugging disruptions in the integrity of
blood vessels 72. Leukocytes – help body fight infection

73. Plasmin – help break down blood clots in the
body

74. Red blood cells – produce hemoglobin molecules,
which transport oxygen throughout body

75. DVT patient – should keep leg elevated when in
bed, can apply warm heat to decrease pain/swelling

76. Scurvy – caused by vitamin C deficiency

77. Stroke patient – priority would be to monitor
patient for increased intracranial pressure
