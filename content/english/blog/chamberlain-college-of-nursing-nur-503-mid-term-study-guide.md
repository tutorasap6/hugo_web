Chamberlain College of Nursing
NUR 503 Mid-Term Study Guide

* Review the objectives of each module.
* Be able to apply concepts addressed in the objectives, integrating the relevant terminology.
* Review assignments and their objectives, including discussion board content and written assignments.

***

### Key Topics to Review:

1. Define and Understand:
   * Population Health: The health outcomes of a group of individuals, including the distribution of such outcomes within the group.
   * HP2020 Objectives and Goals: The national health promotion and disease prevention objectives aimed at improving the health of all Americans.
   * Epidemiology: The study of the distribution and determinants of health-related states or events in specified populations and the application of this study to control health problems.
   * Aim of Epidemiology in Population Health: To identify risk factors for disease and targets for preventive healthcare within populations.
2. Morbidity, Mortality, Incidence, and Prevalence:
   * Understand and compare the different measures of morbidity (illness) and mortality (death).
   * Differentiate between incidence (new cases) and prevalence (existing cases).
3. Understanding Cases:
   * Incidence and Prevalence:
     * Define: Incidence refers to the number of new cases, while prevalence refers to the total number of cases, both new and pre-existing, in a population at a specific time.
     * Importance of Data: Essential for measuring disease risk and understanding the burden of disease within a population.
     * Interpreting Findings: Recognize how these metrics inform public health decisions.
     * Relationship between Incidence, Prevalence, and Duration of Disease: High incidence with low mortality may increase prevalence.
     * Relationship between Prevalence, Incidence, and Mortality: Interconnected factors that impact the burden of disease.
     * Examples: Be able to identify statistics representing incidence and prevalence rates.
4. Surveillance:
   * Importance: Surveillance is crucial for ongoing assessment of public health and identifying emerging health issues.
   * Definition: The continuous, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health data.
   * Passive vs. Active Surveillance:
     * Passive: Relies on healthcare providers to report cases.
     * Active: Involves proactive collection of data by public health authorities.
     * Examples: Be prepared to discuss advantages and disadvantages of each method.
   * Role of the NP: Surveillance is essential in the NP's role in public health, contributing to the early detection of health trends.
5. Measures of Mortality:
   * Understanding and Interpreting Mortality Data:
     * Importance of numerator (number of deaths) and denominator (population at risk) in calculating risk.
     * Absolute Number vs. Rate: Understand the difference and significance of each.
     * Mortality Rates: General and age-adjusted rates.
     * Case-Fatality Rate: The percentage of individuals diagnosed with a disease who die from that disease. Factors influencing this rate.
     * Proportionate Mortality Ratio: The proportion of deaths due to a specific cause.
     * Life-Table Analysis: Ability to describe and apply this method to calculate life expectancy and survival rates.
6. Measures of Validity:
   * Sensitivity: The ability of a test to correctly identify those with the disease (true positive rate).
   * Specificity: The ability of a test to correctly identify those without the disease (true negative rate).
   * Characteristics of a Good Screening Test: Consider reliability, quality, validity, and how to choose an appropriate screening test.
7. Improving Reliability of Screening Tests:
   * Understand methods to enhance the reliability and accuracy of screening tests.
8. Disease Transmission and Outbreaks:
   * Attack Rate: The proportion of those exposed to an agent who develop the disease.
   * Modes of Disease Transmission: Understanding common terms and how diseases spread.
   * Epidemic Curve: Understanding the distribution in single-exposure, common-vehicle outbreaks.
   * Cross-Tabulation: Use tables to identify a source of an outbreak, including calculating and comparing attack rates in food-borne outbreaks.
   * Prevention Measures:
     * Primary: Preventing the initial development of a disease.
     * Secondary: Early detection and treatment to prevent progression.
     * Tertiary: Reducing the impact of an already established disease.
   * Herd Immunity: Differentiating it from other forms of immunity, focusing on community protection.
