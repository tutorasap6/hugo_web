### Chamberlain’s Comprehensive Nursing Program Review Guidelines

Chamberlain’s Comprehensive Nursing Program Review is an essential assignment within the NR452 Capstone Course, forming a crucial part of the Chamberlain Care Student Success Model, which supports students throughout their entire nursing program. This assignment is designed to ensure that students demonstrate mastery of key nursing concepts essential for entry-level practice as registered nurses.

#### Purpose of the Assignment

The primary objective of the NR452 Comprehensive Nursing Program Review is to provide students with an opportunity to apply and synthesize the knowledge they have acquired throughout their nursing program. This includes information gained from previous assignments, SimCare Center activities, and clinical learning experiences. The assignment aims to:

* Synthesize and apply knowledge and clinical reasoning: Encourage the integration of theoretical knowledge with clinical practice.
* Prepare for NCLEX success and transition to nursing practice: Equip students with the readiness needed for successful completion of the NCLEX and the transition into professional nursing roles.

#### Assignment Components

The comprehensive nursing program review includes several critical elements that demonstrate the student's mastery of nursing content:

1. Completion of Self-Study Modules:
   * Students are required to complete a series of 10 modules (orientation plus 9 additional modules) by 11:59 PM, according to their campus time zone, on Wednesday of Week 7, or as scheduled by local campus administration.
   * Each module must be completed individually, following the specific guidelines provided by Virtual ATI.
2. Personalized Remedial Activities:
   * The review includes personalized remedial activities tailored to each student’s performance trends, as determined by their ATI Content Assessments and Virtual-ATI Coach.
   * These activities are designed to address areas of weakness identified in the student's knowledge profile, ensuring targeted improvement and preparation for the NCLEX.

#### Benefits of Completing the Assignment

Meeting all the requirements of the comprehensive nursing program review positions students for first-time success on the NCLEX. By engaging in this thorough review process, students can confidently transition from academic learning to professional nursing practice, equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to excel in their careers.

This assignment is a vital component of the NR452 Capstone Course, serving as both a summative assessment of students’ nursing education and a preparatory tool for their future roles as registered nurses.
