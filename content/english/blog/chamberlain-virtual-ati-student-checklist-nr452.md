### Chamberlain Virtual-ATI® Checklist: Comprehensive Review and Strategies for NCLEX Success

The Chamberlain Virtual-ATI® (Assessment Technologies Institute) is a structured and comprehensive program designed to prepare nursing students for the NCLEX (National Council Licensure Examination). It provides a systematic approach to mastering the critical concepts necessary for success in nursing licensure exams. This program, encompassing multiple modules, engages students in interactive learning experiences, assessment activities, and remediation processes that ensure readiness for the NCLEX. This essay will provide a detailed overview of the Virtual-ATI® program, focusing on the structure, activities, and resources provided in the initial modules of the review process.

#### Module 1: Welcome to Virtual-ATI, Orientation, and Review Resources

The first module of the Chamberlain Virtual-ATI® program is centered on orientation and review resources, ensuring students are adequately prepared for the rigorous journey ahead. Upon receiving the Welcome Email, students are instructed to follow specific steps outlined in the email, including completing necessary documentation if they require accommodations. The orientation process is crucial as it lays the foundation for understanding the program's expectations, resources, and communication protocols.

Students are required to complete the orientation classroom quiz, which helps in familiarizing them with the Virtual-ATI NCLEX Review calendar. This calendar is an essential tool as it outlines the time expectations and scheduling of various activities, ensuring that students remain on track throughout the review process. Additionally, students are guided to review important links such as Product Support & System Requirements and How to Message Your Coach, which are instrumental in navigating the platform and accessing necessary resources.

A significant component of this module is the "Virtual-ATI Start Point," where students are provided with instructions on accessing tutorials on ATI Testing. These tutorials are foundational in building the necessary skills and knowledge required for the NCLEX. The Student Orientation Video, available within this module, serves as a refresher for students, reinforcing key concepts and procedures introduced during the orientation.

Upon completion of the orientation quiz and review of all provided links, students are required to message their coach. This step ensures that students are engaged and have thoroughly understood the orientation materials. The coach's role is pivotal in guiding students through the program, providing feedback, and addressing any concerns that may arise during the review process.

#### Module 2: NCLEX Strategies

The second module focuses on NCLEX strategies, which are vital for students aiming to pass the NCLEX on their first attempt. This module begins with directions for successfully completing the NCLEX Test Taking Strategies Module. Students are provided with access to a variety of resources, including links to NCLEX Test Taking Strategies, NCLEX Resources, NurseLogic® Completion Steps, and Active Learning Templates.

A key activity in this module involves completing all four NurseLogic® Tutorials and their associated Advanced Student Assessments. These tutorials cover essential areas such as Knowledge and Clinical Judgment, Nursing Concepts, Priority Setting Frameworks, and Testing and Remediation. Each tutorial is paired with an Advanced Student Assessment, designed to test the student's understanding and application of the concepts learned.

The Knowledge and Clinical Judgment tutorial, for instance, emphasizes the importance of critical thinking in nursing practice. It teaches students how to apply their theoretical knowledge to clinical scenarios, a skill that is crucial for the NCLEX. The Nursing Concepts tutorial, on the other hand, provides a deep dive into the core concepts that underpin nursing practice, ensuring students have a solid foundation in the fundamentals of nursing.

Priority Setting Frameworks is another critical tutorial in this module. It guides students on how to prioritize patient care, a skill that is often tested in the NCLEX. The Testing and Remediation tutorial focuses on strategies for effectively tackling exam questions and identifying areas that require further review.

After completing these tutorials and assessments, students are encouraged to message their coach, who will provide feedback and guide them on the next steps in the review process. This continuous interaction between the student and coach ensures that students remain focused and receive the necessary support throughout their NCLEX preparation journey.

#### Week 1 Mile Marker: 25% Stage - Module 3: Fundamentals of Nursing

In the third module, the focus shifts to the Fundamentals of Nursing, a core area that is extensively tested in the NCLEX. This module requires students to review the Fundamentals Module Checklist and complete three quizzes: Safety, Fundamentals, and Basic Care. These quizzes are designed to test the student's knowledge and understanding of basic nursing principles, which are crucial for patient care.

Students are also required to complete three Learning System Quizzes on [www.atitesting.com](http://www.atitesting.com): Fundamentals 1, Fundamentals 2, and Gerontology. These quizzes cover a broad range of topics, from basic nursing skills to specialized care for the elderly. The quizzes are followed by a comprehensive Fundamentals Assessment, consisting of 60 questions, with a time allotment of 90 minutes. The Assessment ID and Password for this exam are provided under the Fundamentals Assessment Completion Steps, ensuring that the process is seamless and organized.

After completing the Fundamentals Assessment, students are instructed to create a Focused Review®. This review is a targeted study plan that addresses areas of weakness identified in the assessment. Students are encouraged to spend adequate time reviewing these areas to strengthen their knowledge and improve their performance in future assessments.

The final step in this module involves completing a Post-Assignment provided by the coach, followed by any necessary remediation. Remediation is a critical aspect of the Virtual-ATI® program, as it allows students to revisit and reinforce areas where they may have struggled. Once remediation is complete, students are advised to message their coach with their remediation answers and proceed to the next module, Pharmacology.

#### Week 2 Mile Marker: 25% Stage - Module 4: Pharmacology

The fourth module delves into Pharmacology, an area that requires a deep understanding of medication administration, drug interactions, and patient safety. In this module, students are required to review the Pharmacology Module Checklist and complete the associated learning activities. These activities are designed to reinforce the student's knowledge of pharmacological principles and ensure they are well-prepared for the NCLEX.

Students are encouraged to spend 2–3 hours reviewing the topics in which they are weak. This targeted review helps in consolidating their understanding and addressing any gaps in knowledge. The learning activities in this module are interactive and designed to engage students in active learning, making the complex subject of pharmacology more manageable and less daunting.
