Introduction

My name is Jennie Long, and I am currently pursuing the nurse educator track. With years of experience as a nurse, I have witnessed the significant shift in healthcare towards the adoption of technology and electronic documentation across various organizations. Electronic documentation has undoubtedly streamlined the process of maintaining patient records, making it more efficient and accessible. However, a common challenge I have observed is that many new nurses, particularly those at the undergraduate level, struggle with the appropriate use of technology. These challenges often lead to frustration as they attempt to navigate these complex systems. The purpose of this presentation is to advocate for the integration of a dedicated course on the use of information technology in undergraduate nursing programs, aimed at better preparing new nurses for clinical practice.

Statement of Personal Leadership Style

My leadership style is rooted in transformational leadership. As a transformational leader, I strive to inspire and motivate others to achieve their goals by tapping into their personal attitudes, values, and aspirations. This leadership approach emphasizes the importance of building strong relationships with team members, fostering an environment where they feel valued and empowered. By focusing on individual strengths and potential, transformational leaders help their teams to grow and develop, ultimately driving positive change within the organization.

Advocacy for Change in Undergraduate Nursing Education

The integration of technology in healthcare has revolutionized how patient care is documented and managed. However, the transition from traditional methods of documentation to electronic systems has not been without its challenges, particularly for new nurses. Many undergraduate nursing programs do not adequately prepare students for the realities of using information technology in clinical settings. As a result, new nurses often find themselves overwhelmed by the technical demands of electronic documentation, which can lead to errors, decreased job satisfaction, and increased turnover rates.

To address this issue, I advocate for the inclusion of a comprehensive course on the use of information technology in nursing as part of the undergraduate curriculum. This course should cover the fundamentals of electronic health records (EHRs), the ethical and legal implications of digital documentation, and practical skills for navigating various healthcare information systems. By providing students with a solid foundation in information technology, we can better prepare them for the technological demands of modern nursing practice.

Implementation of the Proposed Change

Implementing this change will require collaboration between academic institutions, healthcare organizations, and technology experts. Nursing educators must work closely with IT professionals to develop a curriculum that is both relevant and practical. Additionally, clinical partners should be involved in the process to ensure that the skills taught in the classroom align with the technological tools used in real-world healthcare settings.

The course should be designed to be interactive and hands-on, allowing students to practice using EHRs and other digital tools in a simulated environment. This experiential learning approach will help students gain confidence in their ability to use technology effectively, reducing the learning curve when they transition to clinical practice. Furthermore, the course should emphasize the importance of ethical considerations in digital documentation, including patient privacy, data security, and accurate record-keeping.

Sustaining the Change

To sustain this change, it is essential to continually update the curriculum to reflect advancements in technology and changes in healthcare regulations. Regular feedback from students, educators, and clinical partners should be used to refine the course content and ensure its relevance. Additionally, ongoing professional development opportunities should be provided for nursing educators to keep them informed about the latest trends and best practices in healthcare information technology.

By institutionalizing this course as a core component of undergraduate nursing education, we can ensure that future generations of nurses are well-prepared to meet the technological demands of their profession. This preparation will not only enhance their ability to provide safe and effective patient care but also contribute to their overall job satisfaction and career longevity.

Conclusion

As a transformational leader and nurse educator, I am committed to advocating for changes that enhance the quality of nursing education and ultimately improve patient care. The integration of a course on information technology in undergraduate nursing programs is a crucial step in preparing new nurses for the realities of modern healthcare. By equipping students with the skills and knowledge they need to navigate electronic documentation systems confidently, we can reduce their frustration, increase their job satisfaction, and improve patient outcomes. This change is not just about adapting to new technology; it is about empowering the next generation of nurses to succeed in an increasingly digital world.
