Nutrition and Weight Health Promotion for Eastern European Immigrants
Chamberlain College of Nursing NR222: Health and Wellness

### Introduction

Eastern European immigrants, who migrate to the United States, often bring with them specific cultural dietary habits that can contribute to health challenges, particularly in the context of nutrition and weight management. These habits typically include low consumption of vegetables and fruits, paired with a high intake of saturated fats. Such dietary patterns can lead to an underestimation of both their own and their children's actual weight status, increasing the risk of obesity and related health issues (Lanari, 2015; Manios et al., 2015).

### Nutrition and Weight Health Promotion

Nutrition and weight health promotion is crucial for Eastern European immigrants, as their weight patterns tend to shift following migration to the U.S. The adaptation to American lifestyles, which often include unhealthy dietary habits and reduced physical activity, can result in a transition from a low to high body mass index (BMI) (Argys, 2015). This transition significantly increases the risk of obesity and related health problems, making it essential to promote healthy eating habits and regular physical activity within this population.

### Eastern European Immigrants Health Status

The term "Eastern Europeans" primarily refers to individuals born in former Eastern Soviet Union territories, such as Poland, Czechoslovakia, the Russian Federation, Hungary, Belarus, and Ukraine (Lanari, 2015). Among this population, obesity is one of the most significant health issues in the United States (Argys, 2015). According to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS, 2015), obesity is a major concern for the non-hospitalized population in the U.S.

Data from 2011–2014 highlights the prevalence of obesity among children and adolescents. For children aged 2–5 years, the obesity rate was 8.9%; for those aged 6–11 years, the rate was significantly higher at 17.5%, and among adolescents aged 12–19 years, it reached 20.5% (NCHS, 2015). These statistics underscore the growing concern regarding obesity in younger populations, which often translates into higher rates of obesity in adulthood.

For adults, the trend is equally concerning. Between 1999–2002 and 2011–2014, the percentage of adults aged 20 and older with class 1 obesity (BMI of 30.0–34.9) increased from 17.9% to 20.6% (NCHS, 2015). Those with class 2 obesity (BMI of 35.0–39.9) saw an increase from 7.6% to 8.8%, while the percentage of adults with class 3 obesity (BMI of 40 or higher) rose from 4.9% to 6.9% (NCHS, 2015).

### Healthy People 2020 and Health Promotion

Recognizing the escalating rates of obesity at a national level, particularly within ethnic groups such as Eastern European immigrants, the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (ODPHP) introduced the "Nutrition and Weight Status" health promotion objective as part of the Healthy People 2020 initiative. Launched in 2010, Healthy People 2020 aimed to provide a comprehensive set of national health objectives that focus on reducing major health risks. This initiative emphasizes the importance of improving dietary habits, increasing physical activity, and managing weight to reduce the incidence of obesity and related health issues across the population, including among Eastern European immigrants.

By focusing on these objectives, healthcare providers can better support Eastern European immigrants in adopting healthier lifestyles that align more closely with the recommendations outlined in Healthy People 2020, ultimately leading to improved health outcomes and a reduction in obesity rates within this community.
