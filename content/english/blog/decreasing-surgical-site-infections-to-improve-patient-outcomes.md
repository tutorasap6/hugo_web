### Slide 1: Title Slide

Title: Decreasing Surgical Site Infections to Improve Patient Outcomes
Name: Caroline Exum
Institution: Chamberlain College of Nursing
Course: NR451 RN Capstone Course
Date: November 2017

***

### Slide 2: Introduction

* Title: Introduction to Surgical Site Infections (SSIs)
* Content:
  * Definition: Surgical Site Infections (SSIs) are infections that occur after surgery in the part of the body where the surgery took place.
  * Significance: SSIs are among the most common healthcare-associated infections, leading to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs.
  * Objective: This presentation aims to explore strategies to decrease SSIs, thereby improving patient outcomes and reducing the burden on healthcare systems.

### Slide 3: The ACE Star Model of Knowledge Transformation

* Title: Overview of the ACE Star Model of Knowledge Transformation
* Content:
  * Purpose: Developed by the Academic Center for Evidence-Based Practice (ACE) to facilitate the integration of evidence into healthcare practice.
  * Interdisciplinary Application: A tool designed to support healthcare professionals in achieving quality improvement goals.
  * Five Points of the Model:
    * Point One: Discovery
    * Point Two: Summary
    * Point Three: Translation
    * Point Four: Implementation
    * Point Five: Evaluation

***

### Slide 4: Detailed Overview of the ACE Star Model Points

* Title: Steps in the ACE Star Model of Knowledge Transformation
* Content:
  * Discovery: Identifying clinical issues and gathering evidence through systematic research.
  * Summary: Synthesizing research findings into a concise summary that can guide clinical practice.
  * Translation: Adapting and applying research evidence into practical strategies suitable for the clinical setting.
  * Implementation: Executing the evidence-based strategies in clinical practice, ensuring adherence to protocols.
  * Evaluation: Assessing the outcomes of the implemented strategies to measure their effectiveness and identify areas for improvement.

### Slide 5: Formulating the PICO Question

* Title: PICO Question to Guide Evidence-Based Practice
* Content:
  * PICO Question: In preoperative surgical patients, is the use of preoperative bathing and showering with skin antiseptics enough to prevent surgical site infections?
  * Purpose: This question focuses on determining the effectiveness of preoperative antiseptic protocols in reducing the incidence of SSIs.

***

### Slide 6: Scope of the Problem

* Title: Understanding the Prevalence and Impact of SSIs
* Content:
  * Incidence: Approximately 300,000 SSIs occur annually in the U.S.
  * Risk: Between 2% and 5% of inpatients undergoing surgery develop SSIs.
  * Mortality: SSIs contribute to a 3% mortality rate among affected patients.
  * Increased Risk: Patients who develop SSIs have a 2-11 times higher risk of death compared to those who do not.
  * Direct Attribution: 75% of deaths among patients with SSIs are directly attributable to the infection (Berríos-Torres, 2009).

***

### Slide 7: The Economic and Systemic Impact of SSIs

* Title: Financial and Systemic Consequences of SSIs
* Content:
  * Preventability: SSIs are considered largely preventable with proper preoperative and postoperative care.
  * Financial Burden: The cost of managing SSIs is significant, with additional resources required for extended hospital stays, readmissions, and treatment of complications.
  * Reimbursement Challenges: Medicare, Medicaid, and other insurance providers often do not cover costs associated with SSIs, placing a financial strain on healthcare facilities.
  * System-Wide Impact: The cumulative costs associated with SSIs affect the entire healthcare system, from resource allocation to patient outcomes.

### Slide 8: Stakeholders Involved in SSI Prevention

* Title: Key Stakeholders in the SSI Reduction Initiative
* Content:
  * Chief Nursing Officer (CNO):
    * Role: Leads the initiative, coordinates the efforts of the surgical team, and ensures adherence to evidence-based protocols.
  * Nurse Manager from Surgical Floor:
    * Role: Prepares and analyzes SSI occurrence rates, adjusts unit budgets to support SSI prevention efforts, and monitors compliance with new protocols.
  * Surgeons and Surgical Team:
    * Role: Implement preoperative and postoperative measures to reduce SSI risk, including the use of antiseptics and sterile techniques.
  * Infection Control Specialists:
    * Role: Provide expertise in infection prevention, conduct regular audits, and train staff on best practices.
  * Patients and Families:
    * Role: Participate in preoperative education, adhere to prescribed antiseptic protocols, and provide feedback on their care experience.

***

### Slide 9: Implementing Change

* Title: Strategies for Reducing SSIs
* Content:
  * Preoperative Measures:
    * Use of antiseptic agents for preoperative bathing and showering.
    * Application of evidence-based guidelines for skin preparation.
  * Intraoperative Measures:
    * Adherence to strict aseptic techniques during surgery.
    * Use of sterile barriers and controlled environments to minimize contamination risks.
  * Postoperative Measures:
    * Monitoring surgical sites for signs of infection.
    * Educating patients on proper wound care and follow-up procedures.
  * Continuous Quality Improvement:
    * Regular review and update of SSI prevention protocols based on the latest evidence and outcomes.

***

### Slide 10: Evaluation and Outcomes

* Title: Evaluating the Effectiveness of SSI Reduction Strategies
* Content:
  * Outcome Metrics:
    * Reduction in SSI rates post-implementation of antiseptic protocols.
    * Improvement in patient outcomes, including reduced morbidity and shorter hospital stays.
  * Cost-Benefit Analysis:
    * Assessing the financial savings from reduced SSIs against the cost of implementing new protocols.
  * Patient Satisfaction:
    * Measuring patient satisfaction levels through surveys and feedback, focusing on their experience with preoperative and postoperative care.
  * Continuous Monitoring:
    * Implementing a system for ongoing surveillance of SSI rates and regular reporting to stakeholders.

***

### Slide 11: Future Directions

* Title: Sustaining and Expanding SSI Prevention Efforts
* Content:
  * Ongoing Education:
    * Continuous education and training for surgical teams on the latest evidence-based practices for SSI prevention.
  * Policy Development:
    * Collaborating with hospital administration to develop and enforce policies that prioritize SSI prevention.
  * Research and Innovation:
    * Encouraging research into new antiseptic agents and techniques to further reduce SSI risks.
  * Patient Engagement:
