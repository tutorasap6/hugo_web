Dr. Thompson NR 566 Final Exam Review Week 5

### Review Chapter 18: Drugs Affecting the Hematopoietic System

#### 1. Anticoagulants (Oral & Parenteral)

***

### Oral Anticoagulants

Warfarin (Coumadin):

* Mechanism of Action: Inhibits synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors X, IX, VII, and II (prothrombin).

Pharmacokinetics:

* Well-absorbed when taken orally.
* Metabolized by CYP 1A2 and 2C9.
* Half-life of 3 to 4 days.

Precautions and Contraindications:

* Pregnancy category X.
* Use cautiously in patients with fall risk, dementia, or uncontrolled hypertension.
* Avoid in hypermetabolic state.
* The major adverse drug reaction is bleeding (Antidote is vitamin K).
* Many drug interactions, including (but not limited to):
  * Antiplatelet drugs
  * Thrombolytic drugs
  * Oral contraceptives, carbamazepine, Vitamin K-containing foods, etc.

Clinical Use and Dosing:

* Drug of choice for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
* Start at 5 mg per day (7.5 mg/day if weight greater than 80 kg).
* Consider lower dose in the following situations:
  * Older than 75 years
  * Multiple comorbid conditions
  * Elevated liver enzymes
  * Changing thyroid status
* Dose to maintain international normalized ratio (INR) between 2 and 3.

Monitoring:

* INR daily until in therapeutic range for 2 consecutive days.
* Then two or three times weekly for 1 to 2 weeks.
* Then less frequently but at least every 6 weeks.

Rivaroxaban (Xarelto): Factor Xa inhibitor.
Apixaban (Eliquis): Factor Xa inhibitor.

* Indications:
  * Reduction of risk of stroke and systemic embolism in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.
  * Prophylaxis of DVT following knee replacement surgery.
  * Treatment of DVT and PE.

***

### Parenteral Anticoagulants

Heparin:

* Mechanism of Action: Binds with the antithrombin III, inactivating factors IXa, Xa, XIIa, XIII.

Pharmacokinetics:

* Given IV or subcutaneously (SC).
* Extensively protein-bound.
* Metabolized by liver and renally eliminated.

Precautions and Contraindications:

* Pregnancy category C.
* Avoid in advanced hepatic or renal disease.
* Avoid in bleeding disorders or active bleeding.

Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs):

* May cause thrombocytopenia.
* Life-threatening bleeding.
* Pain at injection site (SC).
* Antidote is protamine sulfate.

Drug Interactions:

* Cephalosporins and penicillins; Warfarin, antiplatelets and thrombolytics; Valproic acid.

Clinical Use and Dosing:

* Given 2 hours pre-operatively.
* Maintenance every 8 to 12 hours for 7 days after surgery.
* Heparin is processed into smaller molecules â†’ low molecular-weight heparins (LMWH).
* Inactivates factor Xa.

Enoxaparin:

* Indications: DVT or PE.
* Given 2 hours before surgery.

Fondaparinux: Selective inhibitor of antithrombin III and factor Xa inhibitor.

* Indications: DVT, hip fracture surgery, or knee replacement.

Dalteparin:

* Indications: Prevention of DVT after abdominal surgery or hip replacement.

Monitoring for Anticoagulants:

* Activated partial thromboplastin time.
* Platelet and hematocrit (Hct) every 2 to 3 days initially.

Patient Education for Anticoagulants:

* Administration: Warfarin dosing may vary day to day.
