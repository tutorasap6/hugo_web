Chamberlain College of Nursing NR439: RN Evidence-Based Practice - Week 6: Reading Research Literature Worksheet

In the ever-evolving field of nursing, understanding the factors that influence the well-being and job satisfaction of nurses is crucial. The study under review aimed to explore how a sense of "mattering" influences various aspects of nurses' professional lives, such as work scale, work and meaning inventory, social support, burnout, engagement, and responses to open-ended questions. The focus on mattering—a concept that reflects the extent to which individuals feel they are significant and important to others—is particularly relevant in addressing the rising burnout rates among nurses. As the nursing profession continues to grapple with the pressures of high patient loads, emotional demands, and the complexities of modern healthcare, identifying protective factors like mattering could provide valuable insights into improving nurse retention and job satisfaction.

Purpose of the Study

The primary purpose of this study was to examine whether a sense of mattering could positively influence nurses' perceptions across specific categories, including work scale, work and meaning inventory, social support, burnout, and engagement. Given the alarming increase in nurse burnout rates, this study sought to determine if the feeling of mattering plays a role in helping nurses cope with the stressors inherent in their profession. By investigating this relationship, the study aimed to contribute to the broader understanding of how psychological and social factors can affect the mental health and job performance of nurses. The findings of this study could potentially inform strategies to foster a sense of mattering among nurses, thereby reducing burnout and enhancing their overall job satisfaction.

Type of Research & the Design

The study utilized a cross-sectional survey design to collect both qualitative and quantitative data. This mixed-methods approach allowed the researchers to capture a comprehensive view of the nurses' experiences and perceptions. The survey included a variety of questions, most of which were presented in a point-scale format, while the last two questions required narrative responses. The use of both qualitative and quantitative data enabled the researchers to quantify the extent of mattering among the nurses while also gaining deeper insights into their personal experiences and perspectives through open-ended responses.

This design was particularly effective in supporting the study's purpose. By employing a cross-sectional approach, the researchers were able to gather data from a diverse group of nurses at a single point in time, providing a snapshot of the current state of mattering and its impact on various professional outcomes. The inclusion of both scaled and narrative questions allowed for a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between mattering and factors like burnout and social support, which are often complex and multifaceted.

Sample

The study's sample consisted of 362 nurses and nurse practitioners from the United States who worked either full-time or part-time. Out of the total sample, 324 nurses completed the online survey, providing a robust dataset for analysis. The sample was diverse in terms of geographical regions and healthcare settings, which added to the generalizability of the findings. However, the majority of respondents were white, female, held a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN), and had an average age of 39 years, with an average of 12 years of experience as a registered nurse (RN).

This demographic profile highlights the potential limitations in the study's sample diversity, particularly concerning race and gender. While the study provides valuable insights into the experiences of a significant segment of the nursing workforce, future research could benefit from a more diverse sample to ensure that the findings are applicable across different demographic groups.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data collection for this study was conducted using the Eisenberger Social Support Scale, a validated tool designed to measure the level of support nurses perceive from their organizations, supervisors, peers, and other individuals in their work environment. The scale comprises 15 questions, each rated on a 5-point scale ranging from "strongly disagree" to "strongly agree." This tool was instrumental in assessing the extent of social support available to nurses, which is a critical factor in their overall sense of mattering and their ability to cope with job-related stress.

Statistical analyses were performed using the Pearson r statistic for questions involving scales, which allowed the researchers to examine correlations between variables. For the two open-ended questions, content analysis was used to interpret the qualitative data. Descriptive analysis, including measures such as standard deviation, mean, and percentage, was utilized to summarize the results. This comprehensive approach to data analysis provided a clear understanding of how mattering influences various aspects of the nurses' work experience.

Limitations

One limitation of this study was the accuracy and completion rate of the survey. While 362 nurses signed up for the survey, only 324 completed it correctly, resulting in a small portion of the data being unusable. This limitation could potentially impact the generalizability of the findings, as the results are based on a slightly reduced sample size. Future studies might benefit from strategies to improve survey completion rates, such as follow-up reminders or more accessible survey formats.

Findings/Discussion

The findings of the study supported the hypothesis that mattering has a significant impact on nurses' professional lives. Specifically, the study found that a greater sense of mattering was associated with lower burnout rates. As the study noted, “These findings are consistent with our hypothesis that a greater sense of professional mattering may be protective against burnout” (Haizlip et al., 2020). Furthermore, nurses who reported feeling dissatisfied in their responses tended to score higher on burnout measures, indicating a strong link between mattering and job satisfaction.

An interesting aspect of the findings was the importance of peer relationships in influencing work environment satisfaction. The study revealed that peer relationships were more critical to work satisfaction than relationships with managers. This finding resonated with my personal experience in nursing, where I have always valued strong peer relationships. However, I also believe that a good relationship with one’s manager is crucial. Without a positive manager relationship, work can become stressful and unenjoyable, highlighting the multifaceted nature of job satisfaction in nursing.

Reading Research Literature

Nursing is an ever-changing field, with new advancements, practices, and information emerging daily. Being able to read and understand research is essential for staying informed and providing high-quality patient care. When I first began nursing school, I struggled to comprehend scholarly articles, often skipping over tables and statistical data in favor of the conclusions. However, through this class and others, I have learned to appreciate the value of these elements. I now understand the importance of examining tables and statistics, as they provide critical insights into the study's findings and help to interpret the data meaningfully. This skill has enhanced my ability to engage with research literature, enabling me to apply evidence-based practices more effectively in my nursing career.
