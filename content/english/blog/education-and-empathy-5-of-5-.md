#### 3. Vitamins

Followed Up

Description: Danny describes taking vitamins.

* Question: Do you take any vitamins?
  * Time: 09:49 PM CDT
  * Response: Oh yeah, I take vitamins every day! The gummy dinosaur kind. I don't think I'm supposed to, but sometimes I sneak extra ones to be super healthy.
  * Educate: To be healthy doesn't mean you need to take extra. Taking more than recommended will not make you super healthy.
  * Response: Oh, OK.

Model Statement: "You’re right; taking vitamins can be good for you. However, sometimes taking too many vitamins can be bad for you. It’d be better if you don’t sneak extra vitamins—just take the amount that your mom gives you."

#### 4. Secondhand Smoke

Followed Up

Description: Danny describes exposure to secondhand smoke at home.

* Question: Do you smoke?
  * Time: 10:29 PM CDT

  * Time: 10:33 PM CDT

  * Educate: You can talk to Papi; smoking is not good for his health, and secondhand smoke is as bad as smoking.
  * Response: Oh, OK.
