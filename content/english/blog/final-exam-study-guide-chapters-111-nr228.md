### FINAL EXAM STUDY GUIDE: Chapters 1-11 NR228

#### CHAPTER 1: Introduction to Nutrition

1. Calories Provided by Macronutrients:
   * Protein: 4 calories per gram
   * Carbohydrates: 4 calories per gram
   * Fat: 9 calories per gram
   * Alcohol: 7 calories per gram
2. Basics of the Six Categories of Nutrients:
   * Carbohydrates: Primary source of energy.
   * Proteins: Essential for growth and repair.
   * Fats: Concentrated source of energy and aids in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins.
   * Vitamins: Organic compounds needed in small quantities for various biochemical functions.
   * Minerals: Inorganic elements that play key roles in body structure and processes.
   * Water: Essential for all bodily functions and processes.

#### CHAPTER 2: Healthy Eating Patterns

1. Five Food Groups of MyPlate:
   * Fruits
   * Vegetables
   * Grains
   * Protein Foods
   * Dairy
2. Fortification:
   * The process of adding nutrients to foods that don’t naturally contain them or increasing the amount of naturally occurring nutrients to enhance the food’s nutritional value.
3. Nutrients Required on a Food Label:
   * Total Fat: Saturated fat, trans fat, and cholesterol.
   * Sodium
   * Total Carbohydrate: Dietary fiber, total sugars, and added sugars.
   * Protein
   * Vitamins and Minerals: Vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium.

#### CHAPTER 3: Digestion and Absorption

1. Order of Food Passage through the G.I. Tract:
   * Mouth → Esophagus → Stomach → Small Intestine → Large Intestine → Rectum → Anus
2. Chemical vs. Mechanical Digestion:
   * Chemical Digestion: Involves enzymes and other chemicals breaking down food into its nutrient components. Occurs primarily in the stomach and small intestine.
   * Mechanical Digestion: Involves the physical breakdown of food, such as chewing in the mouth and churning in the stomach.
3. Physiological Function of Digestive Organs:
   * Stomach: Secretes acid and enzymes; churns food to create chyme.
   * Small Intestine: Primary site for nutrient absorption; produces enzymes to further break down food.
   * Pancreas: Produces digestive enzymes and bicarbonate to neutralize stomach acid in the small intestine.
   * Liver: Produces bile to emulsify fats for digestion.
   * Gallbladder: Stores and releases bile into the small intestine.
   * Large Intestine: Absorbs water and electrolytes; forms and stores feces.
