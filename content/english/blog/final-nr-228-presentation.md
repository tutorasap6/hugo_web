### Final NR 228 Presentation: Nutritional Assessment in a Preschool Facility

#### Introduction

* Objective: This presentation focuses on assessing the nutritional quality of meals provided to preschool-aged children (2-5 years old) in a suburban preschool.
* Cultural Diversity: The facility serves children from various cultural backgrounds, including:
  * Hispanic
  * Caucasian
  * African-American
  * Asian

#### Current Menu Analysis

1. Breakfast:
   * Importance: Breakfast is a crucial meal as it kick-starts the day and provides essential nutrients for young children.
   * Current Offering: The menu includes muffins and milk.
   * Nutritional Concerns:
     * Muffins: High in sugar, which can cause a quick spike in energy followed by a crash, potentially leading to fatigue and decreased focus.
     * Milk: The current milk offered is high in fat.
   * Recommendations:
     * Muffins: Consider replacing muffins with healthier options like whole grain cereals, oatmeal, or whole wheat toast to provide sustained energy.
     * Milk: Substitute with low-fat or fat-free milk to reduce saturated fat intake.
     * Dairy Requirement: According to MyPlate guidelines, preschoolers require about 2 cups of dairy per day. Adding yogurt or string cheese to the breakfast menu would help meet this requirement.
2. Lunch:
   * Current Offering: The menu includes chicken nuggets, rice, broccoli, and milk.
   * Nutritional Concerns:
     * Chicken Nuggets: Processed foods like chicken nuggets can be high in unhealthy fats and sodium.
     * Lack of Fruit: The menu does not include a fruit serving.
   * Recommendations:
     * Chicken Nuggets: Replace with healthier protein options such as grilled chicken, turkey, or plant-based proteins to reduce processed food intake.
     * Fruit Addition: Add a serving of fruit, such as a whole fruit or a fruit cup, to enhance the mealâ€™s nutritional balance and meet the MyPlate guidelines for a colorful and varied plate.
     * Milk: Consider offering fat-free milk or including another dairy serving to further support calcium and vitamin D intake.
3. Snack:
   * Current Offering: The snack menu includes graham crackers and apple juice.
   * Nutritional Concerns:
     * Both the graham crackers and apple juice contain added sugars, which can contribute to excessive calorie intake and dental issues.
   * Recommendations:
     * Graham Crackers: Replace with healthier snack options like whole-grain crackers, a small portion of nuts, or sliced vegetables with hummus for added fiber and protein.
     * Apple Juice: Substitute with a whole fruit, such as an apple, banana, or orange, to provide more fiber and reduce sugar intake.
