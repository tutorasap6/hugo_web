### Ethical Decision Making

Ethical decision-making involves making choices about ethical issues based on established standards of right versus wrong. It requires a systematic framework for addressing the complex and often controversial moral questions that arise in healthcare. This process ensures that decisions are made thoughtfully and consistently, taking into account the ethical principles that guide professional conduct.

### Bioethical Standards

Bioethical standards refer to the study of healthcare ethics and encompass the principles and guidelines that healthcare providers follow when dealing with ethical issues. Bioethics focuses on the ethical problems encountered in the delivery of care, such as issues related to patient autonomy, informed consent, and end-of-life care.

### Telehealth

Telehealth encompasses a wide range of health services delivered through telecommunications tools, such as telephones, videophones, and computers. Telehealth is increasingly important in addressing the nursing shortage by enabling nurses to see more patients more efficiently. It also plays a crucial role in caring for the aging population by providing convenient access to healthcare services. Telecommunication technologies are used to deliver health-related services and to connect patients with healthcare providers, thereby maximizing patients' health status. As a relatively new term in medical and nursing vocabulary, telehealth represents the integration of advanced technology in the delivery of healthcare services.

### Medical Applications

Medical applications are software programs developed for medical purposes. These include home medical monitoring systems, medical databases for healthcare professionals, and other tools that assist in the delivery of healthcare. Medical applications support clinical decision-making, patient monitoring, and the management of health information.

### Medical Devices

A medical device is any instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, appliance, implant, reagent for in vitro use, software, material, or other similar or related article intended to be used for medical purposes. Medical devices range from simple tools like thermometers to complex machinery like MRI scanners. The development and use of medical devices are overseen by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ensure their safety and effectiveness.

### Privacy

Privacy in healthcare refers to the restricted access to personal information or data. It is a fundamental ethical principle that ensures patient information is kept confidential and is only accessible to authorized individuals. Protecting privacy is essential for maintaining trust between patients and healthcare providers.

### Confidentiality

Confidentiality is the practice of ensuring that all personal information is protected by limiting access to those who are authorized to view it. This means that healthcare providers must take measures to safeguard patient information from unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse. Confidentiality is critical for protecting patient privacy and maintaining the integrity of the healthcare system.

### Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity refers to the protection against the criminal or unauthorized use of electronic data, as well as the measures taken to achieve this protection. With the expansion of technology in healthcare, facilities are increasingly focused on preventing cyberattacks that could compromise patient safety or data integrity. As technology continues to grow, the importance of robust cybersecurity measures becomes even more critical. Nursing informatics professionals are often called upon to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of new devices and software, ensuring that all systems are adequately protected and that patients remain safe from harm.

### Computer-Aided Translators

Computer-aided translation (CAT) is a form of language translation in which a human translator uses computer hardware and software to support and facilitate the translation process. CAT tools assist translators by providing resources such as translation memories, terminology databases, and machine translation suggestions, improving the efficiency and accuracy of translations.

### HIPAA

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) was established in the United States in 1996 to protect individuals' personal healthcare information. Signed into law by President Bill Clinton, HIPAA sets national standards for the protection of health information. Healthcare institutions are required to meet all HIPAA standards and comply with the appropriate security measures to safeguard patient data. HIPAA's Administrative Simplification has four key components:

1. Electronic Transactions and Code Sets Standards Requirements: These standards govern the electronic exchange of healthcare information, ensuring consistency and security.
2. Privacy Requirements: HIPAA's privacy rule establishes national standards to protect individuals' medical records and other personal health information.
3. Security Requirements: The security rule sets standards for the protection of electronic health information, ensuring that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic health data.
4. Administrative Simplification: This component includes provisions for the standardization of electronic healthcare transactions, reducing the administrative burden on healthcare providers and improving the efficiency of the healthcare system.
