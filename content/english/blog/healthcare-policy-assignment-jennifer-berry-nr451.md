### H.R. 3: Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act

This bill, known as H.R. 3, focuses on several key areas aimed at reducing healthcare costs and improving access to care for Medicare beneficiaries. The main provisions include:

* Lower Medication Prices: Aims to reduce the cost of prescription drugs, making them more affordable for patients.
* Decreased Maximum Out-of-Pocket Costs: Establishes a cap on the maximum out-of-pocket expenses for Medicare beneficiaries, helping to alleviate the financial burden on seniors.
* Drug Price Transparency: Requires greater transparency in drug pricing, allowing consumers and healthcare providers to make more informed decisions.
* Expanded Eligibility: Increases the eligibility for medications and coverage, ensuring more Medicare beneficiaries can access necessary treatments.
* Additional Coverage: Includes hearing, dental, and vision programs as part of Medicare coverage, broadening the scope of services available to beneficiaries.
* Multilingual Health Information: Mandates that health information be provided in multiple languages, ensuring that non-English speaking patients can fully understand their treatment options (H.R. 3, 2019).

### Impact on Professional Nursing Standards

H.R. 3 has significant implications for nursing practice, particularly in the areas of coordination of care, implementation, and resource utilization. Key impacts include:

* Coordination of Care: Nurses play a critical role in coordinating patient care, particularly when it comes to managing the complexities of medication regimens and healthcare services. With the introduction of lower drug costs and expanded coverage, nurses will need to assist patients in navigating their healthcare options, ensuring that they understand the implications of their choices.
* Implementation: Nurses will be involved in implementing the changes brought about by H.R. 3, including educating patients on new coverage options and ensuring that they receive the necessary care under the updated Medicare provisions.
* Resource Utilization: As healthcare resources become more accessible, nurses must effectively utilize these resources to meet patients' needs. This includes helping patients weigh the costs, risks, and benefits of different treatment options, ensuring that care decisions are both cost-effective and in the best interest of the patient (ANA, 2015).
* Advocacy: Nurses are responsible for advocating for patients' rights, health, and safety. With the changes proposed in H.R. 3, nurses must actively identify and secure the services patients need, ensuring that all aspects of their health, including hearing, dental, and vision care, are addressed (ANA, 2015).
