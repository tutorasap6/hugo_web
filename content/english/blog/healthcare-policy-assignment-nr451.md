### H.R. 3: Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act

Overview:The Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act (H.R. 3) is a legislative effort aimed at reducing the financial burden of prescription drugs for Americans, particularly those covered by Medicare. The bill includes several key provisions designed to make medications more affordable and accessible:

* Lower Medication Prices: The bill seeks to reduce the cost of prescription drugs by allowing Medicare to negotiate prices directly with pharmaceutical companies.
* Decreased Maximum Out-of-Pocket Costs: It establishes a cap on the maximum out-of-pocket expenses that Medicare beneficiaries must pay for their medications, reducing the financial strain on seniors.
* Drug Price Transparency: The bill mandates greater transparency in drug pricing, allowing consumers to see how drug prices are set and ensuring that price increases are justified.
* Expanding Eligibility: H.R. 3 expands eligibility for medications and coverage, ensuring that more Medicare beneficiaries can access the treatments they need.
* Additional Coverage: The act includes provisions for hearing, dental, and vision care under Medicare, broadening the scope of services available to beneficiaries.
* Multilingual Health Information: The bill requires that health information be provided in multiple languages, ensuring that non-English speaking patients can fully understand their treatment options (H.R. 3, 2019).

### Impact on Professional Nursing Standards

Coordination of Care:

* Role in Care Coordination: Nurses play a crucial role in coordinating care, particularly for patients who are navigating the complexities of Medicare coverage. With the implementation of H.R. 3, nurses will need to be well-versed in the new coverage options and cost-saving measures to effectively guide patients through their healthcare decisions.
* Assisting with Cost-Benefit Analysis: Nurses may need to assist patients in understanding the costs, risks, and benefits associated with different treatment options. This involves helping patients make informed decisions that align with their financial situation and health needs.

Implementation:

* Education and Advocacy: Nurses will be responsible for educating patients about the new benefits and changes introduced by H.R. 3. This includes informing them about the lower drug prices, expanded coverage options, and the importance of adhering to prescribed treatments.
* Resource Utilization: The bill's emphasis on transparency and affordability will require nurses to be proactive in utilizing resources effectively. This might involve helping patients access the additional services covered under Medicare, such as hearing, dental, and vision care.

Advocacy for Patients:

* Rights, Health, and Safety: Nurses are ethically obligated to advocate for their patients' rights, health, and safety. Under H.R. 3, this may include advocating for patients to receive the necessary medications and services at an affordable cost.
* Securing Services: Nurses must be vigilant in identifying and securing the services that patients need, especially as new coverage options become available. This could involve coordinating with other healthcare providers to ensure comprehensive care that addresses all aspects of the patient's health.
