Introduction
In the ever-evolving landscape of healthcare, effective leadership is paramount. The ability to inspire, motivate, and guide a team toward achieving collective goals is a critical component of successful nursing management. As I progress through the Nurse Executive MSN track at Chamberlain University, I have had the opportunity to reflect deeply on my leadership style and how it aligns with my aspirations in the field. This essay will explore the personal leadership style that I embody, present a change advocacy statement, and discuss how my leadership approach can effectively facilitate the proposed change. Through this exploration, I aim to articulate the reasons for selecting this program and how it will help me achieve my career goals in nursing leadership.

Purpose of the MSN Program Selection
The decision to pursue an MSN with a focus on Nurse Executive leadership is rooted in my desire to advance my career in a direction that not only challenges me but also positions me as a pivotal figure in the healthcare system. My current role as a charge nurse in perioperative services has provided me with invaluable experience in managing daily operations, coordinating patient care, and supporting my colleagues. However, I recognize that to effect more significant changes and drive improvements in patient outcomes, I must equip myself with advanced skills in leadership, strategic planning, and organizational management. The MSN program at Chamberlain University offers the academic rigor and practical experience needed to prepare me for roles such as nurse manager or even director of nursing. I am committed to using the knowledge and skills gained from this program to lead healthcare teams with compassion, integrity, and innovation.

Personal Leadership Style
Throughout this course, I have had the opportunity to examine various leadership styles and assess how they resonate with my own beliefs and practices. The leadership style that I have come to identify with most closely is transformational leadership. Transformational leaders are known for their ability to inspire and motivate their teams by creating a shared vision, fostering a supportive environment, and encouraging innovation and creativity. This style of leadership is characterized by the following key attributes:

1. Visionary Thinking: Transformational leaders are forward-thinking and are always looking for ways to improve the status quo. They have a clear vision of what the future should look like and are adept at communicating this vision to their teams in a way that energizes and engages them.
2. Empowerment: A transformational leader empowers their team members by giving them the autonomy to make decisions and take ownership of their work. This empowerment fosters a sense of responsibility and commitment, leading to higher levels of job satisfaction and performance.
3. Personal Integrity: Transformational leaders lead by example, demonstrating high ethical standards and a commitment to the values they espouse. This integrity builds trust and respect within the team, which is crucial for effective leadership.
4. Inspirational Motivation: By articulating a compelling vision and encouraging team members to strive for excellence, transformational leaders inspire their teams to exceed their own expectations and achieve outstanding results.
5. Individualized Consideration: Transformational leaders recognize that each team member is unique, with their own strengths, weaknesses, and personal goals. They provide tailored support and mentorship to help each individual reach their full potential.

These attributes resonate deeply with my approach to leadership. In my current role, I strive to create an environment where my colleagues feel valued, supported, and motivated to perform at their best. I believe that by fostering a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement, we can achieve exceptional patient care outcomes.

Change Advocacy Statement
The change advocacy statement I have selected centers on improving patient safety and reducing the incidence of perioperative complications. Patient safety is a critical concern in all healthcare settings, but it is particularly vital in perioperative services, where the risks of complications are high. My advocacy for this change is driven by the belief that by implementing evidence-based practices, enhancing communication among the surgical team, and fostering a culture of safety, we can significantly reduce the incidence of adverse events in the perioperative setting.

Rationale for Change
The rationale for advocating this change is multifaceted. First, perioperative complications can have severe consequences for patients, including prolonged hospital stays, increased healthcare costs, and, in some cases, life-threatening outcomes. By focusing on patient safety, we can improve patient outcomes and enhance the overall quality of care provided. Second, as healthcare professionals, we have an ethical obligation to do everything in our power to prevent harm to our patients. Implementing practices that reduce the risk of complications is a critical step in fulfilling this obligation. Finally, improving patient safety in the perioperative setting can also have positive effects on staff morale and job satisfaction. When team members know that they are working in a safe and well-organized environment, they are more likely to feel confident in their work and engaged in their roles.

Facilitating Change Through Transformational Leadership
My leadership style as a transformational leader aligns perfectly with the goals of my change advocacy statement. To successfully implement this change, it will be essential to inspire and motivate the entire perioperative team to embrace new practices and continuously strive for excellence. As a transformational leader, I will focus on the following strategies:

1. Creating a Shared Vision: I will work with the surgical team to develop a clear and compelling vision for patient safety in the perioperative setting. By involving the team in the process, we can create a sense of ownership and commitment to the vision.
2. Empowering Team Members: I will empower team members by providing them with the tools, resources, and support they need to implement evidence-based practices. This empowerment will enable them to take an active role in promoting patient safety.
3. Promoting Open Communication: Effective communication is essential for ensuring patient safety. I will foster an environment where team members feel comfortable speaking up about concerns, sharing ideas, and collaborating to solve problems.
4. Leading by Example: As a transformational leader, I will demonstrate my commitment to patient safety by consistently adhering to best practices, supporting my team, and maintaining high ethical standards.
5. Providing Ongoing Support and Education: I will ensure that team members receive the training and education they need to stay current with the latest evidence-based practices. Additionally, I will provide ongoing mentorship and support to help them navigate challenges and continue improving their skills.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the journey through the Nurse Executive MSN track at Chamberlain University has provided me with valuable insights into my leadership style and how it can be applied to effect positive change in the healthcare environment. By embracing the principles of transformational leadership, I am confident that I can lead my team in implementing practices that enhance patient safety and reduce the incidence of perioperative complications. My commitment to continuous learning and improvement will serve as a foundation for my future success as a nurse leader, and I look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead as I continue to advance in my career.
