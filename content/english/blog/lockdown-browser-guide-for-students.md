# LockDown Browser Guide for Students

Effective November 2018 Session | Updated 3/10/20

Online learning has become a staple in modern education, necessitating secure testing environments to maintain academic integrity. One such solution is the RESPONDUS® LockDown Browser®. This guide provides step-by-step instructions for downloading, installing, and using LockDown Browser to ensure a seamless experience during quizzes and exams.

## What is Respondus LockDown Browser?

Respondus LockDown Browser is a custom web browser that locks down the testing environment within learning management systems (LMS). When students use LockDown Browser to take a quiz or exam, they cannot print, copy, go to another URL, or access other applications. This prevents cheating and maintains the integrity of online assessments.

## Download and Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Download LockDown Browser

To begin, you need to download the Respondus LockDown Browser software. If you attempt to access a quiz or exam without it, you will encounter a prompt instructing you to download the browser. Follow these steps:

1. Click the provided link: Download Respondus LockDown Browser.
2. The download will start automatically. If not, ensure your pop-up blocker is disabled or click the download button manually.

### Step 2: Install LockDown Browser

Once the download is complete, you will need to install the software on your computer.

1. Locate the downloaded file, usually found in your "Downloads" folder.
2. Double-click the file to start the installation process.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

### Step 3: Launch LockDown Browser

After installation, you can open the LockDown Browser from your desktop or applications folder.

1. Double-click the LockDown Browser icon to launch the application.
2. The browser may prompt you to close certain applications. Make sure to save any work and close the listed applications before proceeding.

## Accessing Quizzes and Exams

To access your quiz or exam, follow these steps:

1. Open the LockDown Browser.
2. Log into your LMS as you normally would.
3. Navigate to your course and select the quiz or exam.
4. The quiz or exam will open in LockDown Browser, and you will be unable to navigate away from the test environment until you submit your answers.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

* Cannot Install Software: Ensure you have administrative rights on your computer. If you encounter issues, try restarting your computer and running the installation as an administrator.
* Browser Won’t Launch: Make sure all required applications are closed before starting LockDown Browser. Check for any background processes that might need to be terminated.
