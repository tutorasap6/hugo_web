  * Educate patients on the importance of regular dental hygiene to prevent gingival issues.

***

#### 6. Medications Affecting Coagulation: Medication Interactions With Warfarin

(Active Learning Template - Medication, RM Pharm RN 7.0 Chp 25)

***

#### 9. Antibiotics Affecting the Bacterial Cell Wall: Client Education About Cephalosporins

(Active Learning Template - Medication, RM Pharm RN 7.0 Chp 44)

* Key Points:
  * Educate patients about the potential for allergic reactions, particularly if they have a history of penicillin allergy.
  * Advise taking the full course of antibiotics, even if symptoms improve, to prevent antibiotic resistance.
