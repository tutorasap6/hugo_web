### Medical App Critical Appraisal: GoodRx

Name
The medical application I downloaded on my mobile device is GoodRx, an application primarily used for prescription drugs. GoodRx provides users with access to lower-cost prescription medications by comparing prices at various pharmacies and offering discounts through downloadable coupons.

Author
GoodRx was developed by three entrepreneurs: Trevor Bezdek, Doug Hirsch, and Scott Marlette. Trevor Bezdek, Co-Founder & Co-CEO, has a background in developing healthcare and media strategies, most notably with Tryarc, where he earned the President’s Award for leadership. Doug Hirsch, Co-Founder & Co-CEO, was among the first 30 employees at Yahoo and later served as Vice President of Product at Facebook. Scott Marlette, another Co-Founder, was one of the initial engineers and product managers at Facebook. The three developers, leveraging their extensive technology background, aimed to create an application that allows all Americans to access lower-cost prescription drugs. They maintain GoodRx with a dedicated team of experts in technology, healthcare, and business, operating out of their headquarters in Santa Monica, California.

Endorsement
GoodRx is endorsed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which provides the latest research and insights on medications and healthcare to its users. Additionally, the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP), a non-profit organization dedicated to protecting the public, ensures that GoodRx offers accurate and reliable information regarding healthcare concerns and medications. These endorsements underscore GoodRx's commitment to providing trustworthy and up-to-date information to its users.

Operation
GoodRx operates as both a mobile application and a web-based platform, offering users flexibility in how they access the service. The mobile application is particularly useful for users on the go, enabling them to download coupons instantly for use at participating pharmacies. The app is free to download, although users can upgrade their membership to access additional features not available with the free version. The web-based platform offers easier access to a broader range of services, including a comprehensive medication list, online doctor visits, and specialized features like GoodRx for pets. This dual-platform approach ensures that users can choose the method that best suits their needs, whether they are at home or on the move.
