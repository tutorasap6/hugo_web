&#x9;				&#x9;

Liberty University comprises a network of students, Alumni, faculty, staff and supporters that together form a Christian
community based upon the truth of the Bible. This truth defines our foundational principles, from our Doctrinal Statement to the
Code of Honor. These principles irrevocably align Liberty University’s operational procedures with the long tradition of university
culture, which remains distinctively Christian, designed to preserve and advance truth. Our desire is to create a safe, comfortable
environment within our community of learning, and we extend our academic and spiritual resources to all of our students with the
goal of fostering academic maturity, spiritual growth and character development.

&#x9;				&#x9;

Communities are predicated on shared values and goals. The Code of Honor, an expression of the values from which our
Doctrinal Statement was born, defines the fundamental principles by which our community exists. At the core of this code lie two
essential concepts: a belief in the significance of all individuals, and a reliance on the existence of objective truth.

&#x9;				&#x9;

While we acknowledge that some may disagree with various elements of the Code of Honor, we maintain the expectation that our
students will commit to respect and uphold the Code while enrolled at Liberty University.

&#x9;				&#x9;

Adherence to the principles and concepts established within facilitates the success of our students and strengthens the Liberty
community.

&#x9;				&#x9;

The Code of Honor can be viewed in its entirety at https\://www\.liberty.edu/students/honor-code/
