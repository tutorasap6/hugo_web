NR 603 Week 8 Reflection: Program Outcome #4 Integrate Professional Values through Scholarship and Service in Health Care

This course has helped me translate my current knowledge into practice while building confidence in caring for patients at all levels in the healthcare delivery system. I feel like this class really helped to give perspective to the professional identity I want to display in my interactions with patients. As a provider, I want to have the trust and respect of the patients I treat; for me, this occurs when there is open and honest communication and a mutual respect between all parties. The last seven weeks have given me the opportunity to improve and continue to build knowledge and understanding of the importance of creating a treatment plan based on evidence-based guidelines that can measure outcomes of current and future patients. This not only addresses the patient needs but it also protects and promotes the role of the advanced practice nurse as a profession. Healthcare is an ever-changing practice and it is essential that nurse practitioners can practice at the highest level of care.

MSN Essential IV: Translating and Integrating Scholarship into Practice

Recognize that the master’s-prepared nurse applies research outcomes within the practice setting, resolves practice problems, works as a change agent, and disseminates results. My clinical experience in retail health was interesting and allowed me to see a different side of healthcare that I’ve yet had a chance to experience. I was not aware of the limitations that are placed on providers in this setting. As the main provider, you must be able to take on more than one role while still utilizing evidence-based guidelines. This allowed me to be a very important part of the team by triaging the patients, collaborating with my preceptor to develop the plan of care, and educating the patient regarding their condition and how the treatment plan would benefit them.
