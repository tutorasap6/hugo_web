### NR228 Final Exam Study Guide: December 2020

***

#### 1. Post Liver Transplant Nutritional Considerations

* Correct Nutritional Considerations:
  * Total parenteral nutrition or tube feeding may be necessary.
    * This is often required in the early post-transplant period due to the patientâ€™s inability to take in adequate nutrition orally.
  * Other Options:
    * Nutrition is not a concern because the client is overweight - Incorrect; nutrition is crucial regardless of weight status.
    * Fats and carbohydrates are not a concern long term after transplant - Incorrect; both macronutrients need to be carefully managed.
    * A dietary consult would not be necessary for the client - Incorrect; a dietary consult is often essential.

***

#### 2. Nursing Interventions for Enteral Feeding (Multiple Trauma Patient)

* Appropriate Nursing Interventions:
  * Maintain head of bed elevation to prevent aspiration.
  * Monitor for signs of tube feeding intolerance, such as bloating, diarrhea, or vomiting.
  * Check gastric residual volumes regularly to ensure the feeding is being absorbed.
  * Flush the feeding tube with water before and after medications to prevent clogging.
  * Monitor fluid balance, including input and output.
* Remember:
  * Always ensure the tube is in the correct position and assess the patient for signs of discomfort or complications.

#### 3. Nutritional Needs Increase with Infection

* Energy/Nutrient Increase:
  * Typically, energy needs increase by 20-30% during infection to support the immune response and healing process.
  * Specific percentages might vary based on the severity of the infection and patient condition.

***

#### 4. Additional Functions of the GI Tract (Beyond Digestion and Absorption)

* Functions Include:
  * Immune system support by serving as a barrier to pathogens.
  * Production of hormones that regulate appetite and digestion.
  * Maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance.
  * Production of vitamins by gut bacteria, such as vitamin K.

***

#### 5. Fluid Restriction in Cirrhosis

* Incorrect Client Statement:
  * "I can only drink 1200ml of fluid a day, but I can have all the jello I want."
    * Jello, along with ice cream, pudding, and milk, are considered fluids and should be included in the fluid restriction.
  * Other Statements:
    * The other statements, such as understanding fluid limitations and the effect of fluid buildup, are correct.

***

#### 6. Appropriate Oral Feeding for Acute Hepatitis B

* Oral Feeding Recommendations:
  * Small, frequent meals that are low in fat and high in carbohydrates.
  * Avoidance of alcohol and foods that can irritate the liver.
  * Encouraging adequate hydration with fluids that are easy on the liver.

***

#### 7. Heart Disease Death Rates

* True or False:
  * True. Deaths from heart disease have declined, largely due to better management and prevention strategies.

***

#### 8. Change in Nutritional Advice

* Best Statement:
  * "Healthy fats and moderate portions via the Mediterranean diet are being promoted."
    * This diet focuses on healthy fats (like olive oil), whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and moderate protein portions.

***

#### 9. Chronic Lung Disease

* Chronic Lung Disease Example:
  * Emphysema is a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that affects the lungs and causes breathing difficulties.

***

#### 10. Cancer Cachexia Description

* Best Description:
  * Cancer cachexia is a syndrome characterized by weight loss, muscle wasting, and loss of appetite, often seen in patients with advanced cancer.
  * This condition is not simply malnutrition; it is a metabolic syndrome that leads to severe physical decline.
