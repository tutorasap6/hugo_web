### Questions and Answers:

***

Question 1

Carmen Jones:
What are your favorite memories of nursing school from your student days?

Diana Collins:
My favorite memory from nursing school—there are so many great moments, but the one I will share is going to Salt Lake City for my first nursing convention. I was a member of the student nurses association, and a group of us went to a conference in Utah. It was great to be with other students outside the classroom, but also to network with other nurses and learn about leadership and other healthcare issues. It was truly a great experience.

Carmen Jones:
That sounds like a great experience. I am sure you learned a great deal that you shared with your classmates when you returned.

Diana Collins:
Yes, I encourage every nurse to join a nursing organization; it will help one grow in the profession.

Question 2

Carmen Jones:
How did your first year of RN practice compare to your nursing practice today?

Diana Collins:
My first year of practice was great—it was tough trying to navigate the units, understand my scope of practice, work with physicians, and collaborate with all the nurses. There were many challenges I had to navigate, but I grew fast because the unit I worked on was a fast-paced orthopedic neurosurgical unit. I had to pick up the pace quickly and get a good understanding of the unit. It helped that I was a combat medic in the army, so I was not afraid of hard work and persevering. Initially, I was nervous to talk to some of the physicians, but as I grew in my position and became more confident in my skill set, it became much easier for me to have those conversations and advocate for my patients better. Compared to today, I would say I am 100% more confident than I was back then. I have a great deal of knowledge and understanding of the practice, and I know what's required of me as a practitioner. I also know how to better advocate for my patients. It was definitely a growing experience from being a novice to now being more of an expert, although sometimes I hesitate to call myself that because I am still learning. Anyone in healthcare should continue to be a learner because we don't know it all, and healthcare is changing rapidly. The ANA standard is that we remain scholarly in our education; we should be reading evidence-based practice articles to improve our healthcare knowledge, no matter what field we're in. Constantly growing in our field is vital so that we don't become complacent or jaded in healthcare and patient outcomes.

Question 3

Carmen Jones:
What were some nursing practices that you used in your earlier years that are no longer used today? Why are they no longer used?

Diana Collins:
There are many nursing practices we did back then that we don’t use now. A lot of our fundamental teachings have changed. For example, I remember not learning much about culture and diversity in our courses—there wasn’t a specific course that dealt with cultural diversity in healthcare. Now, the focus has shifted to a more holistic approach to healthcare that includes diversity, equity, and inclusion. Each community has different needs, and now, with changing times, we are identifying those needs more. It’s not to say that we didn’t know that back then, but it wasn’t a big part of our educational structure. Today, we focus more on these aspects. Other practices have changed due to evidence-based practices and research that have informed new procedures and techniques, such as how we give injections. But the biggest change for me is the emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion in healthcare, which we are now seeing more of. It’s a pleasure to see it at the forefront.

Carmen Jones:
Yes, that is so true. I’ve noticed many facilities have increased DEI efforts in the workplace to better represent all communities and create a safe space for patients as well.

Question 4

Carmen Jones:
How have specific persons or events significantly impacted your practice over the years?

Diana Collins:
Over the years, I’ve had many people impact my life, and many of those interactions have been significant. One in particular was my first nurse manager, who was the director of our unit. She was amazing—she would never ask us to do something she wasn’t willing to do herself. I remind her often of how her presence impacted me and how I carry myself as a nurse, a nurse educator, and a future DNP. She would come out of her office, throw on a lab coat, and take patient assignments because we were short-staffed. I’ve seen her give bed baths to patients because we were short on staff. I’ve seen her stand up for us to get better services on our unit. She was, and still is, the epitome of what a leader should be. She wasn’t just telling us what to do—she was in the trenches with us. That’s the kind of leader I strive to be.

Carmen Jones:
Wow, that’s amazing. I remember you speaking about her when you taught us about ethics and leadership, and it still gives me chills. Even though I’m a new nurse, I have yet to see that type of leadership on any unit I’ve worked on.

Question 5

Carmen Jones:
How have you impacted the nursing practice of others?

Diana Collins:
I’ve been told that I have (laughing). It’s humbling when former students recall lessons they’ve learned from me and how it influences their nursing practice. I am always honored by that and feel blessed to be a part of their journey.

Carmen Jones:
I know you’ve impacted my career, which is why I chose you for this interview. You play a pivotal role in why I am a nurse, and I appreciate you completely.

Diana Collins:
Thank you, that’s very kind of you.

Question 6

Carmen Jones:
What contributions have you made to nursing in the areas of leadership, provision of care, and/or evidence-based practice?

Diana Collins:
I’ve been part of many initiatives on the hospital units I’ve worked on. One in particular was developing a policy to prevent hospital-acquired UTIs through catheterization. We worked with the Institute of Health to create this policy, and it was great to be part of that leadership and change. It allowed me to be in a leadership position and use evidence and research to improve patient outcomes. I was also part of the team when our hospital transitioned to electronic health records, which was a significant change. That experience allowed me to network with nurses across different units and step out of my comfort zone as a stakeholder in new technology. It was a great experience, and I took away a lot from it.

Carmen Jones:
That’s great. I remember you mentioning being part of that initiative when we discussed improving patient outcomes in hospital settings. You also talked about how you grew in leadership during that time, which helped you step out of your comfort zone.

Question 7

Carmen Jones:
What challenges in today’s nursing can be improved using lessons from the past?

Diana Collins:
That’s a tough question because there are so many lessons we can learn from the past and bring into the present, and vice versa. One area that comes to mind is the culture of caring. I think that was lost a bit, especially during the pandemic, but even before that. Nurses became jaded and overworked, and it seemed like they weren’t getting the appreciation they deserved from their facilities. During the pandemic, nurses saw many patients die alone, which is something we all strive to prevent. That experience impacted many nurses, and some left the bedside due to burnout. I think we need to bring back that culture of caring, and that starts with self-care. We need to remember to care for ourselves so that we can care for our patients.

Carmen Jones:
Yes, I saw that during the pandemic as well. As a new nurse, I noticed a lack of compassion and empathy for patients, especially in long-term care settings. It was disheartening to see.

Question 8

Carmen Jones:
Who is your favorite famous nurse from nursing history?

Diana Collins:
My favorite nurse from nursing history is Mary Mahoney. She was the first African American nurse and one of the first members of the American Nurses Association. She was also a co-founder of the National Association of Colored Graduate Nurses and advocated for healthcare equality. That speaks volumes, especially during a time when African Americans weren’t seen as equal members of society. I continue to strive for diversity, equity, and inclusion in healthcare because of her legacy. Even today, healthcare is not entirely inclusive, and there is still hidden racism and discrimination. Mary Mahoney’s work inspires me to keep advocating for marginalized communities.

Carmen Jones:
Yes, I’ve heard about Mary Mahoney, and I understand the need for advocacy for the Black and Brown communities. There’s still a lot of healthcare bias within the system.

***

Question 9

Carmen Jones:
How do you use that famous nurse’s example in your own practice?

Diana Collins:
I carry Mary Mahoney’s legacy with me everywhere I go. As a nurse of color, I feel she paved the way for us in healthcare. I strive to have equity and inclusion in healthcare for all people, including marginalized communities like the Black and Brown communities and the LGBTQIA+ community. If we allow discrimination against one group, it opens the door for discrimination against many others. That’s why I continue to advocate for diversity, equity, and inclusion in healthcare.

Carmen Jones:
That is so true. I know you are a big advocate for diversity, equity, and inclusion, and that is part of your doctoral work as well, especially related to transgender healthcare. I can see how Mary Mahoney’s work plays a part in your advocacy for marginalized communities.

Question 10

Carmen Jones:
Based on your nursing past, what advice would you give to the new nurse today?

Diana Collins:
The advice I would give to new nurses is, first, take care of yourself because you can’t give from an empty well. Second, examine your personal values and biases and understand where your ethics lie because you will face ethical issues daily. Third, your goal is to take care of patients to the best of your ability, so keeping up with scholarly knowledge is vital. Treat every human being with kindness and respect, regardless of their background. I think some of that has been lost, and it’s important to bring it back.

Carmen Jones:
Yes, you’ve always emphasized treating the patient as a whole. As nurses, we’re holistic practitioners, and we should always be ready to be change agents. What’s been done in the past isn’t always right to continue, and if we see an area for change, we should be willing to step up and make that change.
