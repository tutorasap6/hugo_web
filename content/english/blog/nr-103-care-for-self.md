NR 103: Care for Self
Module 1:
Mindful Rest
➥On average, an adult between the ages of 18 to 60 requires seven or more hours of sleep per 24
hour period. The image on the right shows the age-adjusted percentage of adults who reported
short sleep duration (less than 7 hours of sleep per 24-hour period), by state in the United States
in 2014 (CDC, 2017).
➥Breathing: The importance and how
»Do you know how to take a good deep breath? When you take a deep breath your
stomach should inflate with air the farthest instead of your chest. Belly breathing allows
for the most oxygen exchange in your lungs and it helps relax your muscle fibers so you
get the relaxation response.
➥Ways stress can manifest itself:
»Through the body
»Through the brain
»Through the emotions you feel in a stress response
»The behaviors in a stress response
➥My stress response:
»Body: Stomach aches, heart racing, and my face starts to go numb and tingle
»Brain: I can’t form a cohesive thought, think I am dumb, can’t remember things
»Emotions: I start crying, uncontrollable anger
»Behavior: Can’t sleep, drink more, binge eat
➥Mindful Moments
»Anchoring Practice: Pick one thing you do often throughout your day, pause, take a
mindful breath, and picture yourself completing your next task in a mindful manner.
»Mindfulness into head-to-toe assessments: Avoid going into autopilot, approach patientcare with a focused, beginner’s mind,
»Mindfulness in hand washing: Turn on the water, note the sound it makes, what is the
temp?, put soap in your hand and notice the texture, take in the smell, take in the
color, place hands back into the water, notice how the soap leaves your hands and
goes down the drain, dry your hands and take note of the feel of the paper towel
against your skin.
➥Peace and Calm Sleep
»Peace and Calm meditation: Breath in your head when you inhale “Peace” and then you
exhale think “10” and repeat until you get to 1, and then repeat replacing “Peace” with
“Calm” and work down to 1 and then repeat with “Peace” and “Calm” instead of
numbers.
➥Sleep
