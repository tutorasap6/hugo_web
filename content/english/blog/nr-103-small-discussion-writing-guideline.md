CREDIBLE ACADEMIC SOURCES

Picking the right source is just as important as the information. These papers do not require strict, peer-reviewed research articles as in other classes. Being able to find and evaluate information from the internet is important to steer a patient and yourself to appropriate health information. Some tips:
• References are dated within the last five years
• Your textbooks qualify as an evidence-based source
• Chamberlain Library subscribes to vetted databases for research

SPELLING AND GRAMMAR

• Do not rely on spill chick to locate typos. Spell chock does not now witch words are correct either.
• Numbers below 11 are written out
• Write out all acronyms with first use, no matter how common
• No contractions
• No abbreviations or slang
• Generic medications are not capitalized
• Proofread out loud with purpose to hear grammatical errors and see the typos.
• One thought per sentence. Long, convoluted sentences confuse the reader and detract from your ideas.
• Review the correct usage of punctuation, possession, and plural.
