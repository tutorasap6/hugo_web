NR 103 Week 1 Discussion: [Introductions](https://nursingschooltutors.com/)

## Sample 1

Hi, I am Ameerah Dixon, and I reside in Georgia. I am a dedicated mother of five teenagers and currently work as a Medical Assistant in the medical field. In my spare time, I enjoy crafting and creating projects with my Cricut machine.

I am not new to college courses. I transferred to Chamberlain University from Georgia Military College (GMC), where I completed most of my core courses, including Biology, College Algebra, Anatomy, and others. Although I have not earned any other degrees, my experience at GMC has provided me with a strong educational foundation.

To succeed in my studies, I need an effective system. Typically, I finish assignments the day before they are due, which is not ideal. This semester, I have adjusted my work schedule to help me become a better student and avoid procrastination. I believe that having a set schedule and sticking to it will help me stay on top of my assignments and succeed at Chamberlain as I work towards my nursing degree.

Time management is my most significant challenge while in school. Balancing study time and completing assignments has been a struggle. To address this, I have set aside specific times each day for studying and completing assignments. This structured approach gives me a schedule to follow, helping me stay ahead and avoid falling behind. Being a mom, working full-time, and attending school simultaneously is incredibly challenging, but as I progress, I am learning to manage my time better to achieve my goals.

One of my most difficult challenges in nursing school will be taking care of myself. It is crucial for me to know when to take breaks, get adequate sleep, and manage stress. By prioritizing self-care, I will be better equipped to care for others, making my journey through nursing school a bit easier.
