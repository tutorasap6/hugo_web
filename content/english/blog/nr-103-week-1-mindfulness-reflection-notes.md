## Week 1 Mindfulness Reflection

### Reflection

1\. Of the list provided in the video, what healthy habits do you already use in your daily regimen?

I go to the gym around five in the morning to complete my daily activities. Regular exercise is a critical component of maintaining both physical and mental health, and early morning workouts help set a positive tone for the rest of the day. According to a study by Warburton et al. (2006), regular physical activity can reduce the risk of chronic diseases and improve mental health. I try to consume as many healthy meals as I can, but occasionally I treat myself to junk food. Balancing a healthy diet with occasional indulgences can help sustain long-term dietary habits. I try to limit my caloric intake to maintain a healthy weight and overall wellness. Research by Boeing et al. (2012) supports the importance of a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains for preventing chronic diseases and promoting overall health.

Every day, I try to hydrate as much as I can, as hydration is crucial for bodily functions and cognitive performance (Popkin, D’Anci, & Rosenberg, 2010). Despite my busy schedule, I always strive to get at least 7 hours of sleep. Sufficient sleep is essential for physical health, cognitive function, and emotional well-being (Hirshkowitz et al., 2015). I constantly encourage myself with these three phrases whenever I feel like I am veering off course: "You will achieve because I can do it" and "I got this!" Positive self-talk and affirmations can significantly boost motivation and resilience (Tod, Hardy, & Oliver, 2011).

2\. What healthy habits mentioned that you do not currently use, what might you consider adapting into your life?

The videos explained many positive habits that I do not practice in my day-to-day activities. For instance, I have never used the 4-7-8 breathing technique. This method involves inhaling for four seconds, holding the breath for seven seconds, and exhaling for eight seconds. It is designed to promote relaxation and reduce anxiety, which can be beneficial for stress management (Weil, 2015).

I have also never meditated while concentrating on my body scan. Body scan meditation involves mentally scanning the body from head to toe, paying attention to any areas of tension or discomfort. This practice can increase awareness of physical sensations and promote relaxation (Kabat-Zinn, 1990). He talked about doing 5–10 minutes of meditation in the morning and at night, which can help start and end the day with a calm and focused mind. Research indicates that regular meditation can reduce stress, improve concentration, and enhance emotional well-being (Goyal et al., 2014).

He also discusses ways that encourage mental health, such as engaging in activities that promote mental well-being. As a result, I prefer to adapt from this video and will practice 4-7-8 breathing techniques to relax. Always meditating before night and in the morning to relieve stress and anxiety can be beneficial for mental health (Black et al., 2015). Engaging in all the things that make up your daily routine is a great way to lower your stress and anxiety levels. But the most vital thing is to always work on yourself. Continuous self-improvement and adopting new healthy habits can lead to a more balanced and fulfilling life.
