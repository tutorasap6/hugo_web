### 1. When taking care of patients, why do you think it is important to utilize the appropriate resources?

Utilizing appropriate resources when caring for patients is crucial primarily due to patient safety. Nurses are tasked with the responsibility of administering medications and treatments, and ensuring that the correct dosages and procedures are followed is vital. For instance, administering the right amount of medication requires precision, which is supported by resources such as medication guidelines, electronic health records, and pharmacology references. Hospitals offer a wide array of resources designed to assist nurses in providing safe and effective care. This includes medical equipment, diagnostic tools, and consultation with specialists. The appropriate use of these resources ensures that patients receive comprehensive and accurate care, minimizing the risk of errors and enhancing patient outcomes. Proper resource utilization also facilitates the identification and management of potential complications early, contributing to a safer hospital stay for the patient.

### 2. How do you think evidence from nursing journals affects patient care?

Evidence from nursing journals significantly impacts patient care by enhancing patient education and mitigating misinformation. Nursing journals provide peer-reviewed, scientifically validated information that helps nurses stay current with the latest advancements and best practices in healthcare. This evidence-based knowledge allows nurses to educate patients accurately, addressing and correcting any misinformation they may have encountered before visiting a healthcare facility. Misinformation can lead to patients not receiving necessary care or making misguided health decisions. According to Villarruel and James (2022), misinformation is characterized by information that is not true, inaccurate, or misleading. By utilizing evidence from nursing journals, nurses can present factual, up-to-date information to patients, improving their understanding of their health conditions and the rationale behind their treatment plans. This enhances patient compliance, satisfaction, and overall health outcomes.

### 3. What role does using the right evidence play in being a professional nursing student?

Using the right evidence is essential for professional nursing students as it hones their critical thinking and decision-making skills. Engaging with evidence-based resources teaches nursing students to evaluate and apply information effectively, a fundamental aspect of clinical practice. This skill is crucial for making informed, evidence-based decisions in real-time patient care scenarios. By relying on credible sources, nursing students learn to discern between high-quality and low-quality information, fostering a mindset geared towards continuous learning and professional development. The ability to critically appraise and utilize the right evidence supports the nursing student's ability to provide high standards of care and adapt to evolving clinical practices.

### 4. What role do understanding plagiarism and academic integrity play in being a professional nursing student?

Understanding plagiarism and academic integrity is paramount for professional nursing students as these concepts are foundational to ethical practice and professional credibility. Plagiarism undermines the trustworthiness of academic work and can have severe consequences for a student's academic and professional career. Nursing students must learn to properly reference and cite sources to avoid plagiarism, thus demonstrating respect for the intellectual property of others and adherence to ethical standards. Carter et al. (2019) emphasize that issues of plagiarism extend beyond the classroom to the clinical environment. If not addressed early, poor understanding of plagiarism and academic integrity can lead to unethical practices in clinical settings, such as falsifying patient records or claiming credit for others' work. Therefore, mastering these principles ensures that nursing students develop a strong ethical foundation, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of the nursing profession throughout their careers.
