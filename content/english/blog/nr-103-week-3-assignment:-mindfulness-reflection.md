### Reflection Questions:

1\. The dietician discusses that you “eat to live, not live to eat.” She describes the 80/20 rule of eating. What percentage of “empty calories” do you think you consume in a day, and what results mentioned in the video do you experience when you eat “too many” empty calories?

Upon honest reflection, I estimate that "empty calories" constitute approximately 50% of my daily intake. This high percentage stems from my frequent consumption of sugary beverages like boba, Jamba Juice smoothies, sugary lemonades, and blended Starbucks coffees. Additionally, due to the convenience and accessibility of packaged chips and junk foods, I often resort to these options when stressed and pressed for time between school and work. These foods are not only tasty but also require minimal preparation, making them an easy choice during busy periods. The dietician in the video mentions several adverse effects of consuming too many empty calories, such as nutrient deficiencies, energy crashes, and persistent food cravings. Personally, I experience sluggishness, sugar highs, and continuous food cravings despite consuming a large number of calories from non-satiating foods throughout the day. These effects significantly impact my overall well-being and energy levels.

2\. What interventions can you apply to help meet the ratio of good calories/empty calories?

In the video "Benefits & Components of a Healthy Diet," the dietician provides several practical strategies to improve the ratio of good calories to empty calories. She emphasizes the importance of focusing on quality, consuming a variety of foods, and combining foods for sustained energy and satiety. To focus on quality, it is essential to choose whole foods over pre-packaged, processed options. One helpful tip is to shop the perimeter of the grocery store where fresh produce and protein sources are typically found, as opposed to the middle aisles where processed foods are displayed. The dietician also introduces the "apple test," which involves considering whether you would eat an apple when feeling hungry. If the answer is no, you might be experiencing a craving rather than genuine hunger. This test can help prevent overeating and encourage healthier choices. To achieve satiety and consume more nutrients, the dietician advises pairing carbohydrates, such as fruits, bread, and rice, with protein sources like nuts, eggs, and poultry. Additionally, starting meals with non-starchy vegetables can promote a feeling of fullness more quickly and prevent overeating. Non-starchy vegetables provide substantial volume in the stomach, making you feel full faster, while also delivering a high nutrient content without excessive calories.
