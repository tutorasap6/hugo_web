### NR103 Transition to the Nursing Profession Week 3: Mindfulness Reflection Template

The NR103 Transition to the Nursing Profession course places a significant emphasis on mindfulness and its impact on personal and professional growth. One of the critical aspects explored in Week 3 is the relationship between diet, health, and mindfulness, as illustrated by the dietician’s discussion in the assigned video. This reflection aims to delve into the concepts presented, specifically focusing on the principle of "eat to live, not live to eat," and the 80/20 rule of eating, drawing on two specific examples from the video to support the analysis.

#### Reflection on "Eat to Live, Not Live to Eat"

The dietician in the video stresses the importance of adopting the mindset of eating to live rather than living to eat. This philosophy underscores the necessity of making food choices that nourish and sustain the body, rather than those driven by cravings or emotional needs. One example from the video that highlights this concept is the discussion about mindful eating practices. The dietician explains that mindful eating involves paying full attention to the experience of eating and drinking, both inside and outside the body. This means noticing the colors, smells, textures, flavors, temperatures, and even the sounds of food, as well as one's reactions to these sensations. By doing so, individuals can make more conscious and healthier food choices, aligning with the idea of eating to sustain life.

#### The 80/20 Rule of Eating

The 80/20 rule, as explained by the dietician, suggests that 80% of the time, individuals should focus on consuming nutritious, whole foods that fuel their bodies efficiently. The remaining 20% can be reserved for more indulgent foods. This balanced approach allows for flexibility and enjoyment without compromising overall health. Another pertinent example from the video is the dietician’s personal anecdote about meal planning. She shares how she applies the 80/20 rule in her life by preparing wholesome meals during the weekdays and allowing herself some dietary leeway during the weekends. This approach not only helps in maintaining a balanced diet but also prevents the feelings of deprivation that often lead to binge eating.

#### Reflection on Personal Eating Habits

Reflecting on my own eating habits in light of the dietician’s insights, I estimate that approximately 30% of my daily calorie intake comprises empty calories. These are calories from foods and drinks that provide little to no nutritional value, such as sugary snacks, sodas, and processed foods. When I consume too many empty calories, I experience several adverse effects mentioned in the video. For instance, I often feel sluggish and find it challenging to concentrate on my studies and other responsibilities. This lack of energy and focus can be attributed to the rapid spikes and drops in blood sugar levels caused by these nutrient-poor foods.

Moreover, the video highlights the emotional consequences of poor dietary choices. Consuming too many empty calories often leaves me feeling guilty and dissatisfied. This emotional burden can create a vicious cycle of emotional eating, where I turn to more unhealthy foods for comfort, perpetuating the cycle of poor nutrition and negative feelings.

#### Conclusion

The concepts of "eat to live, not live to eat" and the 80/20 rule of eating, as discussed in the NR103 Week 3 video, provide valuable insights into the importance of mindful and balanced eating. By adopting these principles, individuals can make healthier food choices that support both their physical and emotional well-being. Reflecting on my own dietary habits, I recognize the need to reduce my intake of empty calories to improve my overall health and quality of life. Embracing mindfulness in eating can help me achieve this goal, fostering a more balanced and nourishing relationship with food.
