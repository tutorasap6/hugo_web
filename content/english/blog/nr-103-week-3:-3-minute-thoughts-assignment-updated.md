### Week 3: 3-Minute Thought Assignment

1\. What source do you use to get credible information when you are writing a paper?

When writing a paper, I utilize a variety of credible sources to ensure the information is accurate and trustworthy. Primarily, I rely on academic databases such as PubMed, JSTOR, and Google Scholar, which provide access to peer-reviewed journal articles. Additionally, I use websites ending in .edu and .gov, as these are typically associated with educational institutions and government agencies, respectively, ensuring a high level of credibility. The school’s library resources, including digital libraries and specific search engines provided by the institution, are also valuable for accessing reputable and scholarly content.

2\. Why is it important to have credible information in your writing and also for publication?

Having credible information in your writing and publications is crucial for several reasons:

* Accuracy and Reliability: Credible sources ensure that the information presented is accurate and reliable, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of the research.
* Trustworthiness: Readers are more likely to trust and value your work if it is based on verified and reputable sources.
* Ethical Responsibility: Using credible sources is part of ethical writing practices, helping to avoid the dissemination of false or misleading information.
* Professional Reputation: Credible and well-researched publications enhance the author's professional reputation and contribute positively to their field of study.
* Impact on Decision-Making: In fields such as healthcare, credible information is vital as it can influence critical decisions affecting patient care and outcomes. Incorrect or unreliable information could potentially harm individuals or lead to legal repercussions for healthcare providers.

3\. What makes a journal article credible?

Several factors contribute to the credibility of a journal article:

* Peer-Review Process: Articles published in peer-reviewed journals have been evaluated by experts in the field for accuracy, validity, and quality before publication.
* Reputable Authors and Institutions: Articles written by recognized experts or affiliated with reputable institutions (universities, research organizations) are generally more credible.
* Citations and References: A credible article includes extensive references and citations to support its claims, allowing readers to verify the sources of the information.
* Methodological Rigor: Articles that demonstrate a clear, rigorous methodology and provide detailed descriptions of their research processes are more credible.
* Publication Venue: Articles published in established and reputable journals are typically more credible than those in lesser-known or non-peer-reviewed publications.

4\. What is the concern with using Google as your first source?

Using Google as your first source for research can present several concerns:

* Quality and Reliability: Google’s search results include a wide range of sources, many of which may not be credible or reliable. This includes websites with biased, inaccurate, or unverified information.
* Wikipedia Pitfall: Google searches often lead to Wikipedia, which, while a good starting point, is not always reliable due to its open-edit nature, allowing anyone to add or alter content without rigorous oversight.
* Credibility Verification: It can be challenging to verify the credibility of sources found through a general Google search compared to academic databases or institutional websites.
* Information Overload: The vast amount of information can be overwhelming and time-consuming to sift through to find credible sources.

For these reasons, it is advisable to use academic databases, institutional resources, and other trusted sources for credible and reliable information when conducting research and writing papers.
