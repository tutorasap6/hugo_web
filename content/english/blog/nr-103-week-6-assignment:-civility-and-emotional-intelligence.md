Civility and Emotional Intelligence

As a pre-licensed healthcare professional, I recognize that civility and emotional intelligence are essential components of my future practice. Through my training at Chamberlain School of Nursing and the Edapt program, I have come to appreciate the significance of these concepts. Two critical aspects of communication that I have focused on are emotional intelligence and the different levels and types of communication. Understanding and applying these elements can significantly enhance my interactions and outcomes in the healthcare setting. This essay will explore my reflections on mindful civility and emotional intelligence, particularly how they can be applied to nursing practice.

Civility in the Workforce

Civility in the workplace is fundamental to professional success. Civility encompasses kindness, courtesy, and respect, which foster a positive environment for both colleagues and patients. It is crucial to address and correct uncivil behaviors among colleagues to maintain a respectful and productive work environment. Effective communication is key to ensuring that messages are received as intended, promoting understanding and collaboration. Additionally, coaching and mentoring are essential practices that contribute to professional growth and success in nursing.

Emotional Intelligence in Communication

Emotional intelligence is integral to effective communication. It includes self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. These competencies are vital for nurses to build strong relationships with both colleagues and patients. Emotional intelligence enhances our ability to manage our emotions and understand the emotions of others, leading to better interactions and patient care. Developing these skills can significantly impact the quality of care provided and improve overall job satisfaction.

Mindful Relationships

The prefrontal cortex plays a crucial role in our emotional responses and behaviors. When the left side of the prefrontal cortex is stimulated, it is associated with positive feelings such as altruism and happiness, along with reduced stress levels and improved immune responses. In contrast, stimulation of the right side is linked to negative feelings, increased fear, and anxiety. Mindfulness and emotional intelligence are closely connected, as being mindful helps enhance our emotional and social competencies. Emotional intelligence, defined as the ability to understand and manage our own emotions and the emotions of others, is essential for coping with daily demands and pressures in the nursing profession.

Incivility in the Workplace

Incivility is defined as rude or discourteous behavior, often involving a power imbalance between the perpetrator and the victim. A culture of incivility can develop when such behavior becomes normalized, leading to bullying and lateral violence. Lateral violence refers to disruptive and inappropriate behavior among colleagues of equal or higher positions. This toxic environment requires secrecy, shame, and silent witnesses to persist. Addressing incivility and promoting a culture of respect and support are vital for a healthy work environment.

Conclusion

In conclusion, recognizing the importance of civility and emotional intelligence is crucial for a balanced and effective work life. These skills enhance understanding and collaboration among colleagues and improve interactions with patients. Practicing self-care, politeness, and gratitude are essential aspects of civility and emotional intelligence. Utilizing these skills will play a significant role in my development as a professional nurse, contributing to a positive and productive work environment.
