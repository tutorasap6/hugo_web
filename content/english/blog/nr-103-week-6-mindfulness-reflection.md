Week 6 Mindfulness Reflection

In the video, Tom discussed the concept of a “Reference Group,” emphasizing how this group can significantly impact one's success and failure. He suggested that it is crucial to keep five people close, as you will become the combined average of these individuals. The three main areas that will be influenced by this group are attitude, health, and income. These areas encompass emotional states, health and fitness habits, and financial and success habits, respectively.

Currently, the person I spend the most time with is my boyfriend. Despite our opposite work schedules—I work the night shift six days a week, and he works the day shift five days a week—we make it a point to spend three to four hours together most evenings. During this time, we hang out and talk, providing each other with support and motivation.

My boyfriend plays a crucial role in keeping me motivated financially, academically, and professionally. His favorite saying, “It ain’t nothing but a thing,” helps ground me when I am struggling emotionally and mentally. His positive influence and support have become invaluable in maintaining my well-being and achieving my goals.
