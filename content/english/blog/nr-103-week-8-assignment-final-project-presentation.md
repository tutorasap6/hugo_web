NR 103 Week 8 Assignment Final Project Presentation

NR 103 Week 8 Assignment: Final Project Presentation

My inspiration means that I want to be a nurse who is caring, competent, and compassionate. I want to be a nurse who is always learning, growing, and improving. I want to be a nurse who is respectful, ethical, and professional. I want to be a nurse who is a leader, a team player, and a change agent. I want to be a nurse who is passionate, curious, and creative.

WHAT CONCEPT CHALLENGED YOU DURING THIS COURSE?

One concept that challenged me during this course was emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand and manage oneâ€™s own emotions and the emotions of others. It is an important skill for nurses because it helps them to communicate effectively, build rapport, resolve conflicts, cope with stress, and provide empathic care. However, emotional intelligence is not something that can be easily learned or measured. It requires self-awareness, self-regulation, social awareness, and social skills. It also requires practice, feedback, and reflection. I found it challenging to assess and improve my emotional intelligence, and to apply it in different situations and scenarios.

WHAT HAS BEEN THE GREATEST LESSON YOU HAVE LEARNED?

The greatest lesson I have learned during this course is that nursing is not only a science but also an art. Nursing is not only about knowing the facts, theories, and principles, but also about applying them in practice. Nursing is not only about performing the tasks, procedures, and interventions, but also about creating the relationships, experiences, and outcomes. Nursing is not only about following the rules, standards, and policies, but also about using judgment, creativity, and intuition. Nursing is not only about being a nurse, but also about being a human being.

HOW WILL WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNED HELP YOU BE SUCCESSFUL AT CHAMBERLAIN UNIVERSITY?

What I have learned during this course will help me be successful at Chamberlain University by preparing me for the academic, clinical, and professional expectations and challenges that I will face as a nursing student. It will also help me develop the knowledge, skills, and attitude that I need to become a competent, confident, and compassionate nurse. It will also help me connect with my peers, instructors, and mentors, and to benefit from their support, feedback, and guidance. It will also help me achieve my goals, fulfill my potential, and realize my vision.
