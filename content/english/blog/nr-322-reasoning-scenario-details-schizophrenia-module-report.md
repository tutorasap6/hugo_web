### Decision Log:

#### Scenario: Daniel’s mother calls the urgent care hotline.

* Question: Daniel’s mother explains to Nurse Kathy the events that have just taken place. Which of the following is the appropriate response by Nurse Kathy?
* Selected Option: "I’m going to contact an ambulance to bring your son into the emergency room."
* Rationale: The client’s current behavior poses a safety risk and requires immediate intervention. Arranging ambulance transport provides the most immediate care and safety for both the client and his mother.

#### Scenario: Nurse Kathy responds to Daniel’s refusal for admission.

* Question: Nurse Kathy is talking with Daniel and his mother. Which of the following is an appropriate response by Nurse Kathy to Daniel’s refusal of admission?
* Selected Option: "Ms. Morris, because of Daniel’s current needs, you can agree to a temporary admission for diagnosis and treatment."
* Rationale: Due to the client’s acute symptoms, the provider is legally permitted to initiate a temporary admission for up to 15 days, with informed consent from the client’s mother.

#### Scenario: Nurse Kathy gives a report for Daniel’s admission.

* Question: Nurse Kathy is preparing to give a report to Nurse Amber. Use the SBAR format to identify the findings Kathy should include when giving the report.
* Selected Option:
  * Situation: Daniel Morris, a 17-year-old male, was brought to the emergency department by his mother. He exhibited auditory hallucinations at home, appeared anxious, paced the exam room, and spoke incomprehensibly. His vital signs were stable, urine toxicology was negative, and his blood glucose was 90 mg/dL. Due to the acute nature of his symptoms, Dr. Khan recommended admission.
  * Background: Approximately one year ago, Daniel’s father lost his job and subsequently committed suicide seven months ago. Since then, Daniel's mother reports that he has become withdrawn and obsessed with basketball. His grades have dropped, and he began taking fluoxetine (Prozac) six months ago. This evening, Daniel became visibly upset, angry, and was heard having auditory hallucinations.
  * Assessment: Daniel appears visibly anxious, with incomprehensible speech, and is pacing around the room.
  * Recommendations: Dr. Khan has written a behavioral plan, which will be implemented as soon as possible.

#### Scenario: Daniel becomes agitated during his room admission.

* Question: Which of the following interventions by Nurse Amber is appropriate when Daniel remains agitated?
* Selected Option: Administer haloperidol (Haldol).
* Rationale: The nurse should first employ the least restrictive intervention, such as administering haloperidol to reduce agitation and anxiety before considering more restrictive measures.

#### Scenario: Daniel remains agitated after receiving haloperidol.

* Question: What action should Nurse Amber take if Daniel remains agitated after receiving haloperidol?
* Selected Option: Place the client in physical restraints until he calms down.
* Rationale: Since administering haloperidol was ineffective and Daniel continues to pose an immediate risk of harm, applying physical restraints is appropriate.

#### Scenario: Daniel is placed in restraints due to aggressive behavior.

* Question: What is the appropriate intervention for Nurse Amber to take while Daniel is in restraints?
* Selected Option: Observe Daniel directly while restraints are in place.
* Rationale: Direct observation is necessary to ensure the client’s safety due to his increased agitation.

#### Scenario: Nurse Amber identifies symptoms of schizophrenia.

* Question: Which findings are positive symptoms of schizophrenia? (Select all that apply.)
* Selected Options: Disorganized speech, auditory hallucinations, acute paranoia.
* Rationale: These are positive symptoms, as they are abnormal features present in schizophrenia.

#### Scenario: Nurse Mike cares for Daniel during his initial treatment with risperidone (Risperdal).

* Question: What intervention should Nurse Mike include during the initial treatment?
* Selected Option: Monitor orthostatic blood pressure every 4 hours.
* Rationale: It is essential to monitor for orthostatic hypotension during initial risperidone treatment due to the associated risk.

#### Scenario: Nurse Mike provides education to Daniel’s mother.

* Question: What should Nurse Mike say about the risk of schizophrenia in Daniel’s twin brother?
* Selected Option: "Having an identical twin with schizophrenia significantly increases the risk of developing the disorder."
* Rationale: Research indicates that an identical twin has about a 50% risk of developing schizophrenia if the other twin has it.

#### Scenario: Nurse Mike provides discharge teaching.

* Question: What should be included in the relapse prevention plan for Daniel?
* Selected Option: "Daniel should participate in group therapy to decrease the risk of relapse."
* Rationale: Group therapy can help Daniel better understand the disease, learn coping strategies, and develop a support system, all of which can reduce the risk of relapse.

#### Scenario: Daniel is in the emergency department, upset and hostile.

* Question: How many mL of lorazepam (Ativan) should Nurse Kathy administer when the prescribed dose is 1 mg and available dose is 2 mg/mL?
* Selected Option: 0.5 mL.
* Rationale: With 2 mg/mL available, 0.5 mL is the appropriate volume to administer for a 1 mg dose.

#### Scenario: Nurse Kathy responds to Daniel’s delusion.

* Question: What is an appropriate response when Daniel claims to be a professional basketball player?
* Selected Option: "Tell me more about basketball and what is important to you about the sport."
* Rationale: This therapeutic communication technique helps build rapport and provides insight into the client’s delusion.

#### Scenario: Nurse Kathy gathers assessment data on Daniel’s acute crisis.

* Question: Which audio clip displays the speech alteration known as neologisms?
* Selected Option: “It’s very schmoo of yem.”
* Rationale: Neologisms are words that are made up and have no meaning to others, which is demonstrated in the selected audio clip.

#### Scenario: Nurse Nicole discusses risperidone (Risperdal) with Daniel.

* Question: What should Nurse Nicole mention about the risk for extrapyramidal side effects (EPSs)?
* Selected Option: "Risperidone has a low risk for EPSs but can cause weight gain."
* Rationale: While risperidone has a low risk for EPSs, clients should be aware of the potential for weight gain as a side effect.

#### Scenario: Nurse Nicole completes the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) assessment.

* Question: Which action is appropriate during the AIMS examination?
* Selected Option: Shine a penlight in the client’s mouth to observe the tongue at rest.
* Rationale: Observing the tongue at rest for abnormal movements is part of the AIMS assessment.

#### Scenario: Nurse Nicole documents Daniel’s weight on a growth chart.

* Question: Where should Daniel’s weight be documented on the growth chart?
* Selected Option: Where age 18 and 75 kg meet.
* Rationale: The nurse should document the weight where the horizontal line for age intersects with the vertical line for weight on the growth chart.
