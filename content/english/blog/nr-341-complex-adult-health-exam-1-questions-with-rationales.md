A nurse is caring for a group of older adult clients. Which of the following manifestations indicates one of the clients is experiencing delirium?

* A. A client wants to know the current time while there is a clock on the wall.
* B. A client attempts to climb out of bed and repeatedly states she must get home.
* C. A client requests extra blankets when the thermostat in the room indicates 25.6 Degrees C (78 F).
* D. A client refuses to get out of bed and has no motivation to attend to daily hygiene.
* Correct Answer: B.

(Delirium is characterized by a change in cognition that occurs over a short period of time. It results from a secondary physiological condition (e.g., infection, surgery, prolonged hospitalization, hypoxia, fever, medications) and is a transient disorder. Although delirium can occur with any age, it is more common in older adults. It frequently progresses in the evening hours and is sometimes called "sundown syndrome." Delirium is characterized by alterations in memory, agitation, restlessness, illusions, or hallucinations. A client who becomes acutely confused and agitated may be showing manifestations of delirium.)

A community health nurse is providing teaching to the family of a client who has primary dementia. Which of the following manifestations should the nurse tell the family to expect?

* A. Decreased auditory and visual acuity.
* B. Decreased display of emotion.
* C. Personality traits that are opposite of original traits.
* D. Forgetfulness gradually progressing to disorientation.
* Correct Answer: D.

(Dementia usually appears first as forgetfulness. Other manifestations may be apparent only upon neurologic examination or cognitive testing. Loss of functioning progresses slowly from impaired language skills and difficulty with ordinary daily activities to severe memory loss and complete disorientation with withdrawal from social interaction.)

A nurse is caring for a client who has dementia. When performing a Mental Status Examination (MSE) the nurse should include which of the following data? (Select all that apply.)

* A. Ability to perform calculations
* B. Level of consciousness
* C. Recall ability
* D. Long-term memory
* E. Level of orientation
* Correct Answer: A, C, E.

(Evaluating the client's ability to perform calculations is an included component of an MSE. Determining the client's level of consciousness is not a component of an MSE. Identifying the client's ability to recall a list of objects or words is an included component of an MSE. Evaluating long-term memory is not a component of an MSE. Determining the client's level of orientation is an included component of an MSE.)

A nurse is caring for a client who has dementia due to Alzheimer's disease and was admitted to a long-term care facility following the death of her partner of 40 years. The client states, "I want to go home; my husband is waiting for me to cook dinner." Which of the following responses by the nurse is appropriate?

* A. "This is where you live now."
* B. "This is a safer place for you to live."
* C. "Tell me what you like to cook for dinner."
* D. "Your family said there is no one to care for you at home."
* Correct Answer: C.

(Alzheimer's disease is a progressive cognitive disorder. Dementia due to Alzheimer's disease means that the client is experiencing the later stages of the illness with moderately severe to severe cognitive decline. By asking the client to talk about what she likes to cook for dinner, the nurse is demonstrating validation therapy by asking the client to talk about the areas that concerned her. The nurse could continue the conversation by discussing how much the client misses her home and partner. Validation therapy helps clients who have cognitive disorders discuss their feelings about past events and people.)

A nurse on a long-term care unit is creating a plan of care for a client who has Alzheimer's disease. Which of the following interventions should the nurse include in the plan?

* A. Rotate assignment of daily caregivers.
* B. Provide an activity schedule that changes from day to day.
* C. Limit time for the client to perform activities.
* D. Talk the client through tasks one step at a time.
* Correct Answer: D.

(The nurse should plan to talk the client through tasks one step at a time to minimize confusion and promote independence, which will decrease the client's anxiety level.)

A nurse is caring for a client who is cognitively impaired. Which of the following rooms will provide a therapeutic environment for this client?

* A. A room adjacent to the nursing station
* B. A room without a window
* C. A room with dim lighting
* D. A room containing personal belongings
* Correct Answer: D.

(A room that contains several of the clients personal belongings assists in maintaining personal identity and provides a therapeutic environment)

The family of an older adult client brings him to the emergency department after finding him wandering outside. During the initial assessment, the nurse notes that the client flinches when she palpates his abdomen yet responds to questions only by nodding and smiling. Which of the following factors should the nurse identify as a likely explanation for the client's behavior?

* A. He is hard of hearing
* B. Pain
* C. Confusion
* D. Language barrier
* Correct Answer: C.

(Since the client was manifesting signs of confusion before coming to the emergency department and currently seems unable to understand or respond to speech, the nurse should determine that the client has confusion.)

A nurse is performing a mental status examination (MSE) on a client who has a new diagnosis of dementia. Which of the following components should the nurse include? (Select all that apply.)

* A. Grooming
* B. Long-term memory
* C. Support systems
* D. Affect
* E. Presence of pain
* Correct Answer: A, B, D.

(Grooming is included in an MSE which consists of appearance, behavior, speech, mood, disorders of the form of thought, perceptual disturbances, cognition, and ideas of harming self or others. Long-term memory is included in an MSE which consists of appearance, behavior, speech, and mood, disorders of the form of thought, perceptual disturbances, cognition, and ideas of harming self or others. Support systems are not included in an MSE which consists of appearance, behavior, speech, mood, disorders of the form of thought, perceptual disturbances, cognition, and ideas of harming self or others. Affect is included in an MSE which consists of appearance, behavior, speech, and mood, disorders of the form of thought, perceptual disturbances, cognition, and ideas of harming self or others. The presence of pain is not included in an MSE which consists of appearance, behavior, speech, mood, disorders of the form of thought, perceptual disturbances, cognition, and ideas of harming self or others.)

A nurse is caring for a client who has late stage Alzheimer's disease and is hospitalized for treatment of pneumonia. During the night shift, the client is found climbing into the bed of another client who becomes upset and frightened. Which of the following actions should the nurse take?

* A. Assist the client to the correct room.
* B. Place the client in restraints.
* C. Re-orient the client to time and place.
* D. Move the client to a room at the end of the hall.
* Correct Answer: A.

(Assisting the client to the correct room protects both clients. It helps re-orient the client who is unable to find her own room, and it prevents the other client from an invasion of her personal space.)

A nurse in a long-term care facility is caring for a client who has late stage Alzheimer's disease. Which of the following actions should the nurse include in the plan of care?

* A. Post a written schedule of daily activities.
* B. Use an overhead loudspeaker to announce events.
* C. Provide a consistent daily routine.
* D. Allow the client to choose free time activities.
* Correct Answer: C.

(A consistent daily routine is appropriate for the care of a client who has Alzheimer's disease.)

A nurse is monitoring a client who is post-operative and unable to respond to questions. Which of the following nonverbal behaviors should the nurse identify as an indication that the client has pain? (Select all that apply.)

* A. Restlessness
* B. Grimacing
* C. Moaning
* D. Clenching
* E. Drowsiness
* Correct Answer: A, B, D.

(Restlessness is correct. Clients who have uncontrolled pain often become restless and anxious in response to the discomfort. Grimacing is correct. Facial movements such as grimacing, tightly closing the eyes, and biting the lower lip are behavioral indicators of pain. Moaning is incorrect. Moaning, groaning, crying, and screaming are vocalizations, not nonverbal behaviors, that indicate pain. Clenching is correct. Clenching the teeth and biting the lower lip are common findings in clients who have pain. Drowsiness is incorrect. Agitation and aggressiveness, not drowsiness, are common indicators of pain.)

A nurse is caring for a client who is one day post-operative following gynecologic surgery and reports incisional pain. Which of the following actions should the nurse take first?

* A. Determine the time the client last received pain medication.
* B. Measure the client's vital signs, including temperature.
* C. Ask the client to rate her pain on a scale of from 0 to 10.
* D. Re-position the client and offer her a back rub.
* Correct Answer: C.

(Using evidence-based practice, the nurse should first determine the severity of the client's pain by using a standard pain scale. Then the nurse can plan the appropriate interventions.)

A nurse is planning care for a client who is post-operative. Which of the following statements about pain management should the nurse consider when implementing client care? (Select all that apply.)

* A. Use of analgesics will eventually lead to addiction.
* B. Each client's expression of pain may be different and individualized.
* C. Patient controlled analgesia (PCA) offers a constant level of opioids within therapeutic range.
* D. Pain level and tolerance can be assessed using a scale from 0 to 10.
* E. The client will express the feeling of pain both verbally and nonverbally.
* Correct Answer: B, C, D, E.

(Use of analgesics will eventually lead to addiction is incorrect. The administration of analgesics does not lead to addiction. This is a common misconception about pain management.)

A nurse is caring for a client who requests prescription pain medication. Which of the following actions should the nurse perform first?

* A. Re-position the client.
* B. Administer the medication.
* C. Determine the location of the pain.
* D. Review the effects of the pain medication.
* Correct Answer: C.

(The first action the nurse should take using the nursing process is to assess the client. By determining the location of the pain, the nurse can take the necessary steps to alleviate the client's pain, such as administering pain medication, repositioning the client, and teaching the client about the effects of the medication.)

A nurse is applying a cold compress for a client who has pain and minor swelling in a suture laceration on the forearm. Which of the following assessments should the nurse use to determine whether the treatment is effective?

* A. Inspecting the site for reduced swelling
* B. Monitoring the client's pulse rate
* C. Asking the client to rate the pain
* D. Having the client perform range of motion of the affected arm
* Correct Answer: C.

(Pain is a subjective experience. The nurse should encourage the client to quantify the pain on a pain scale before, during, and after cold application to determine its effectiveness.)

A nurse is caring for a client who is receiving heat applications using an aquathermia pad. Which of the following actions should the nurse take when applying the pad?

* A. Set the pad's temperature to 47.2°C
* B. Stop the treatment if the client's skin becomes red
* C. Leave the pad in place for at least 40 minutes
* D. Use safety pins to keep the pad in place
* Correct Answer: B.

(The temperature setting for most aquathermia pads is 40°C (104°F). Reactions such as unusual pain or redness are indications for removing the pad and notifying the provider. The heat application should last no longer than 30 min. Safety pins can puncture the pad and cause leakage. The nurse should use gauze or tape to keep the pad in place.)

A nurse is caring for a client who is post-operative. The nurse should base her pain management interventions primarily on which of the following methods of determining the intensity of the client's pain?

* A. Vital sign measurement
* B. The client's self-report of pain severity
* C. Visual observation for nonverbal signs of pain
* D. The nature and invasiveness of the surgical procedure
* Correct Answer: B.

(Because nurses cannot measure pain objectively, it is standard practice to accept that pain is what the client says it is and to intervene accordingly.)

A nurse is caring for a client who requires cold applications with an ice bag to reduce the swelling and pain of an ankle injury. Which of the following actions should the nurse take?

* A. Apply the bag for 30 minutes at a time.
* B. Reapply the bag 10 minutes after removing it.
* C. Allow room for some air inside the bag.
* D. Place the bag directly on the skin.
* Correct Answer: A.

(The nurse should leave the bag in place for 30 min, but should check the client's skin after 15 min to make sure there are no adverse effects.)

A nurse is caring for a client who is post-operative following a cholecystectomy and reports pain. Which of the following actions should the nurse take? (Select all that apply.)

* A. Offer the client a back rub.
* B. Remind the client to use incisional splinting.
* C. Identify the client's pain level.
* D. Assist the client to ambulate.
* E. Change the client's position.
* Correct Answer: A, B, C, E.

(Offer the client a back rub is correct. Nonpharmacological comfort measures can improve pain management. Remind the client to use incisional splinting is correct. Holding a pillow against the incision when moving, turning, or coughing can help the client with self-management of pain. Identify the client's pain level is correct. The nurse should use a standard scale to determine and document the severity of the client's pain. Assist the client to ambulate is incorrect. If the client reports pain, the nurse should implement interventions to manage the pain, such as administering analgesia and giving it time to take effect, before assisting the client to ambulate. Change the client's position is correct. Nonpharmacological measures for managing pain include repositioning, imagery, and distraction.)

A nurse is performing a pain assessment for a client who is alert. The nurse should recognize that which of the following measures is the most reliable indicator of pain?

* A. Vital signs
* B. Self-report of pain
* C. Severity of the condition
* D. Nonverbal behavior
* Correct Answer: B.

(According to evidence-based practice, the most reliable indicator of pain is the client's self-report of pain. A pain intensity scale is a reliable tool to identify the client's pain level.)
