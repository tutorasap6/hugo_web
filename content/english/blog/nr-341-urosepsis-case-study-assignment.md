  * Administer bicarb if related to metabolic acidosis
  * Monitor patient if also taking metformin for diabetes, especially in the case of poor kidney function
  * Correct dehydration (if applicable)

### Primary problem and pathophysiology

Primary problem:

* Urinary tract infection

Underlying cause/pathophysiology:

* Bacterial contamination of the sterile urine usually occurs by retrograde movement of gram-negative bacilli into the urethra and bladder and then to the ureter and kidney. The infection causes an inflammatory response causing edema in the bladder wall, which brings on symptoms of bladder fullness with decreased volumes of urine and producing the urgency and frequency of urination associated with UTI.

### Medical management

Care provider orders:

* Establish peripheral IV
* NS 1000 mL bolus
* Acetaminophen 650 mg
* Ceftriaxone 1g IVPB after blood and urine cultures obtained
* Rationales:Expected outcomes:
  * IV access for fluids and antibiotics
  * Fluids for rehydration
  * Tylenol for temperature and pain
  * Antibiotic for UTI
  * Pain reliever

  * Better fluid balance and rehydration
  * Pain and fever reduced
  * Treat infection

### Priority setting

Order of priority:

* IV access
* Blood and urine cultures
* NS bolus
* IVPB Ceftriaxone
* Acetaminophen
* Rationale:
  * IV access is the fastest way to rehydrate the patient and give medications
  * Obtain cultures (blood while getting IV access). Needs to be obtained before initiating antibiotic
  * NS bolus for hydration and decreased BP
  * Antibiotic started
  * Acetaminophen to decrease temperature
  * Morphine PRN

### Medication dosage calculation

Ceftriaxone 1g IVPB:

* Mechanism of action: Bind to the bacterial cell wall membrane, causing cell death
* Volume/time frame to safely administer: 50 ml
* Hourly rate IVPB: Obtain history of any reactions to penicillins or cephalosporins
* Nursing assessment/consideration:
  * Observe for signs of anaphylaxis
  * Monitor bowel functions

### Nursing Interventions

Interventions:

* Routine perineal hygiene
* Answer call lights quickly and offer the bedpan or urinal to bedridden patients at frequent intervals
* Rationale:Expected outcomes:
  * These measures can prevent incontinence and decrease the number of incontinent episodes
  * Maintaining adequate fluid intake

  * Experience normal urinary elimination patterns
  * Report relief of bothersome urinary tract symptoms
  * Verbalize knowledge of treatment regime

### Body systems to assess

* Renal
* Cardiovascular
* Respiratory
* Integumentary (skin and temperature)
* Neurological (altered mental status)

### Worst possible complication to anticipate

* Urosepsis: a systemic infection arising from a urologic source. Prompt diagnosis and effective treatment are critical because it can lead to septic shock

### Nursing assessment for identifying complications

* Physical assessment findings
* Monitor respiratory status
* Monitor labs
* Assess patient for signs of infection and improvement
* Assess patient for septic shock
* Vital signs
* Continuous cardiac monitoring

### Nursing interventions if complications develop

* Obtain cultures from all possible sources, including blood, urine, sputum, oropharynx, and perineal regions, and IV site
* Begin treatment immediately with antibiotics appropriate for the usual residual flora
* Monitor vital signs closely

### Psychosocial needs of patient and family

* Determine the functionality of the family and the patient’s and family’s developmental level
* Discuss treatment plan and any further questions

### Evaluation and nursing priorities

Has status improved or not as expected?

* Thus far, the patient has made some improvements, but not as expected. The patient does not appear to be in acute distress. Upper and lower extremities are mottled in appearance and cool to the touch. Pulses are strong and heart sounds regular and equal with palpation.

Does your nursing priority need to be modified?

* Yes, monitor for decreased neurological status and respiratory failure.

Nursing priorities and plan of care:

* Monitor BP, neurological status, and respiratory status.

### SBAR Report

Situation:

* 82-year-old female came to the ED for UTI, showing worsening symptoms of BP 102/50, no urine output in the past 2 hrs, and lactate level 3.2.

Background:

* Patient had NS IV bolus, and started on Ceftriaxone.

Assessment:

* Patient is showing decreased neurological status and mottling in upper and lower extremities. Concerned she is becoming septic.

Recommendation:

* Do you want to do another bolus? Do you wish to draw more cultures? I suggest ICU admission.

Has the status of the patient improved?

* No, the patient is now exhibiting signs of septic shock with an increase in temperature, RR, and HR as well as a decrease in BP.

### Education Priorities and Discharge Planning

1. Patient must adhere to prescriptions and dietary changes. Exercise is encouraged. Proper fluid intake is needed to maintain kidney function. Schedule follow-up appointments and reinforce the need for regular appointments to monitor health status. Encourage family support and interaction in a healthy lifestyle.
2. Have the patient repeat back the instructions provided.

### Caring and the “Art” of Nursing

1. The patient may be fearful and nervous about returning home after continuous monitoring in the ICU.
2. Engage with the patient on a personal level, use active listening, open-ended questions, and offer opportunities for more conversation. Be sympathetic.

### Reflection

1. The scenario reinforced the importance of paying attention to every detail, actively listening to patients, and constantly assessing to keep patients healthy and safe.
2. Use this experience to improve the level of care provided to future patients, focusing on priority assessment and interventions for disorders.

Education Priorities and Discharge Planning
1\. Patient must adhere to prescriptions and dietary changes. Exercise is encouraged. Along
with diet, proper intake of fluid is needed to maintain kidney function. A follow up
appointment should be scheduled and reinforce the need for regular appointments to
monitor health status. Encourage family support and interaction in healthy lifestyle.
2\. Have the patient repeat back to me the instructions I have taught her.
Caring and the “Art” of Nursing
1\. The patient may be very fearful and nervous about returning home after continuous
monitoring in the ICU.
2\. It is important that the patient know how involved you (as her nurse) are in her care.
Relate to her on a personal level, engage in active listening, use open-ended questions,
and offer her the opportunity to engage in more conversation. Be sympathetic.
Reflection
1\. This scenario reinforced the fact that we must pay attention to every detail. We need to be
actively listening to our patients and constantly assessing in an effort to keep our patients
healthy and safe.
2\. I can use this in the future to improve the level of care that I give to my patients. This
scenario involved the complication of a disorder and why we need to know our priority
assessment and interventions for disorders.
