Discussion: Practices from the Past - Catherine McAuley's Philosophy of Careful Nursing

Catherine McAuley's philosophy of careful nursing, which emphasizes a holistic and compassionate approach to patient care, is as relevant today as it was in pre-Nightingale times. Among the 10 key concepts of her philosophy, the concept of "Therapeutic Use of Self" stands out as a timeless and crucial aspect of nursing practice.

### Therapeutic Use of Self in McAuley’s Time

In McAuley’s era, nursing was not yet a formalized profession, but the essence of caregiving was deeply rooted in the nurse's ability to connect with patients on a personal level. The therapeutic use of self involves the nurse’s conscious and deliberate use of personality, insights, and communication skills to foster healing relationships with patients. During McAuley’s time, this concept would have been manifested in the way nurses offered comfort and support to patients not only physically but emotionally and spiritually as well. Nurses would have spent time sitting with patients, listening to their fears and concerns, offering reassurances, and providing a calming presence, which was crucial in a time when medical interventions were limited.

### Therapeutic Use of Self in Contemporary Nursing Practice

Today, the therapeutic use of self remains a vital component of professional nursing practice. In modern healthcare, this concept is applied through various means:

* Building Trust: Nurses develop trust with their patients by being present, attentive, and empathetic in their interactions. This involves actively listening to patients' concerns, understanding their emotional needs, and providing appropriate responses that reassure and comfort them.
* Patient-Centered Care: Nurses use their understanding of patients’ individual needs, preferences, and backgrounds to tailor care that is respectful and responsive to each patient’s unique situation.
* Maintaining Professional Boundaries: While nurses build close relationships with patients, they must also maintain professional boundaries to ensure that these relationships remain therapeutic and do not become personal.
* Cultural Competence: In today’s diverse society, therapeutic use of self also involves being culturally competent, understanding, and respecting the cultural beliefs and practices of patients, and integrating these into the care plan.
* Advocacy: Nurses advocate for their patients, ensuring their voices are heard in the healthcare system and that they receive the care and respect they deserve.

### Conclusion

The concept of therapeutic use of self is a cornerstone of nursing that has endured through the centuries. It reflects the core of what it means to be a nurse—using one’s own presence and communication skills to foster healing, provide comfort, and advocate for patients. Whether in McAuley’s time or in today’s modern healthcare environment, this key concept remains essential to the practice of nursing and the provision of compassionate, holistic care.
