Week 2: Practices from the Past Nursing Essay

NR390: Nursing History

Introduction

Catherine McAuley, a 19th-century Irish nurse and the founder of the Sisters of Mercy, developed a philosophy of "careful nursing" that remains relevant in modern nursing practice. McAuley's approach emphasized holistic care that considered not only the physical condition of patients but also their emotional, spiritual, and moral needs. This essay will explore one of the ten key concepts of McAuley’s philosophy, "Care the Person and the Condition," and discuss how this concept was applied in McAuley’s time and how it can be integrated into contemporary nursing practice.

Care the Person and the Condition

McAuley’s concept of "Care the Person and the Condition" advocates for a holistic approach to nursing care, where nurses attend to the entirety of the patient's needs rather than focusing solely on the illness or condition. In McAuley’s time, this meant that nurses provided not only physical care but also emotional and spiritual support to their patients. McAuley believed that by caring for the whole person, nurses could foster a healing environment that promoted both physical recovery and emotional well-being (Byrne, 2012).

During the 19th century, medical knowledge and technology were limited, and much of nursing care relied on the nurse's ability to comfort and support the patient. Nurses in McAuley’s time were often responsible for creating a compassionate and caring environment, listening to patients' concerns, and offering reassurance. This approach was especially important in an era when patients often faced long periods of illness with limited access to effective treatments (Cusack, 2015).

Application in Modern Nursing Practice

The principle of "Care the Person and the Condition" is still highly relevant in contemporary nursing practice. Today, nurses are encouraged to adopt a holistic approach to patient care, recognizing that a patient's emotional, spiritual, and social needs are as important as their physical health. This concept aligns with the modern emphasis on patient-centered care, which seeks to treat patients as individuals with unique needs and preferences (Institute of Medicine, 2010).

In current practice, nurses apply this concept by engaging in active listening, providing emotional support, and respecting the cultural and spiritual beliefs of patients. For instance, nurses may spend time with patients, discussing their fears and anxieties, offering comfort through compassionate communication, and advocating for their needs within the healthcare system (Watson, 2008). By focusing on the whole person, nurses can help improve patient outcomes and satisfaction, which is a core goal of modern healthcare.

Conclusion

Catherine McAuley's philosophy of careful nursing, particularly the concept of "Care the Person and the Condition," remains a cornerstone of nursing practice today. By embracing this holistic approach, nurses can ensure that they provide comprehensive care that addresses the full spectrum of patient needs. McAuley's vision continues to guide and inspire nurses to deliver compassionate, patient-centered care that goes beyond treating illness to promote overall well-being.
