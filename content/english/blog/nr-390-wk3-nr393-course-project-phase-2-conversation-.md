### Interview Questions and Responses

Kathleen Martinez (Student):
Can you tell me what initially inspired you to pursue a career in nursing?

Jeanette Gonzalez (Selected Nurse):
I was inspired to become a nurse because of my mother. She was a nurse herself, and growing up, I watched her care for patients with such compassion and dedication. I knew from a young age that I wanted to follow in her footsteps and make a difference in people’s lives.

Kathleen Martinez (Student):
How has your nursing practice evolved over the years, particularly with the changes in healthcare technology and patient care practices?

Jeanette Gonzalez (Selected Nurse):
When I first started, we relied heavily on paper charts and manual processes. Over the years, the integration of electronic health records and other technologies has drastically changed how we document and deliver care. While it was a challenging transition, it has greatly improved the efficiency and accuracy of our work. Additionally, I’ve had to continuously update my skills to stay current with these advancements, which has made me a more adaptable and knowledgeable nurse.

Kathleen Martinez (Student):
What do you consider to be your most significant achievement in your nursing career?

Jeanette Gonzalez (Selected Nurse):
One of my proudest achievements was receiving the Daisy Award for my work in the specialty clinics. It was an honor to be recognized by my peers and patients for the compassionate care I provide. This award reminded me of why I entered this profession in the first place – to make a positive impact on people’s lives.

Kathleen Martinez (Student):
How do you maintain compassion and empathy in your work, especially when dealing with difficult situations or patients?

Jeanette Gonzalez (Selected Nurse):
It’s definitely challenging at times, but I always try to put myself in the patient’s shoes. I remind myself that they’re going through something difficult, and it’s my job to help them feel cared for and supported. Taking a moment to connect with each patient on a personal level, even if it’s just through a kind word or a smile, goes a long way in maintaining that compassion and empathy.

Kathleen Martinez (Student):
What advice would you give to new nurses entering the field today?

Jeanette Gonzalez (Selected Nurse):
My advice would be to never stop learning and always stay curious. Nursing is a field that’s constantly evolving, and it’s important to stay updated with the latest practices and technologies. Also, take care of yourself. Nursing can be demanding, and self-care is crucial to avoid burnout. Lastly, always remember why you chose this profession – to care for others – and let that be your guiding principle.
