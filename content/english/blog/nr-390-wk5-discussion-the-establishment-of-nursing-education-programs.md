Progress in Nursing in the Early-to-Mid 20th Century: The Establishment of Nursing Education Programs

One significant area of progress in nursing during the early-to-mid 20th century was the formalization and expansion of nursing education programs. This period saw the transition from informal, apprenticeship-based training to structured, curriculum-driven programs within academic institutions. This change was instrumental in shaping nursing into a recognized and respected profession, with an emphasis on standardized education, professional competency, and scientific knowledge.

### The Rise of Formal Nursing Education

In the early 1900s, nursing began to move away from hospital-based apprenticeship programs, where training was largely unstandardized and focused more on providing cheap labor than on education. The establishment of formal nursing education programs in colleges and universities marked a pivotal shift. Influential leaders such as Isabel Hampton Robb and Adelaide Nutting were at the forefront of this movement. They advocated for the inclusion of nursing theory, science, and clinical practice in nursing curricula, which elevated the educational standards of the profession (Donahue, 2011).

By the 1920s and 1930s, nursing education had increasingly moved into higher education institutions, where programs became more rigorous and began to include subjects such as biology, anatomy, physiology, and pharmacology. This shift not only improved the quality of nursing care but also enhanced the professional status of nurses by emphasizing the importance of education and clinical expertise (Kalisch & Kalisch, 2004).

### Application of This Change in Contemporary Nursing

The progress in nursing education during the early 20th century laid the foundation for the current model of nursing education, which continues to evolve. Today, the emphasis on formal education in nursing is stronger than ever, with advanced degrees such as the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN), Master of Science in Nursing (MSN), and Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) being essential for specialized roles and leadership positions. The push for higher education in nursing is also reflected in the recommendations from the Institute of Medicineâ€™s (IOM) 2010 report, The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health, which advocates for increasing the proportion of nurses with a BSN degree to 80% by 2020 (Institute of Medicine, 2010).

Moreover, the foundation of formal nursing education established in the early 20th century is critical in addressing contemporary challenges in healthcare. For instance, the integration of evidence-based practice (EBP) into nursing curricula is essential for preparing nurses to apply the latest research findings to clinical practice, ensuring high-quality patient care. Additionally, the focus on interprofessional education, which encourages collaboration among healthcare professionals, is rooted in the early emphasis on formal education and has become increasingly important in today's complex healthcare environment.

### Conclusion

The formalization of nursing education in the early-to-mid 20th century was a transformative development that continues to impact the profession today. By establishing a standardized, science-based curriculum, early nursing leaders ensured that nurses were equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to provide high-quality care. This emphasis on education remains vital as the nursing profession continues to evolve, adapting to new challenges and advancements in healthcare. The legacy of this progress is evident in the ongoing efforts to advance nursing education and promote lifelong learning among nurses.
