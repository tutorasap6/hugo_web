Chamberlain College of Nursing NR439: Evidence-Based Practice - Week 6: Reading Research Literature Worksheet

Purpose of the Study:
The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of coloring pre-drawn mandalas in reducing short-term anxiety among medical-surgical nurses and other nursing support staff, compared to other activities typically done during scheduled break times, such as resting, watching television, and using personal mobile phones (Maguire, 2020). The study seeks to determine whether engaging in the activity of coloring pre-drawn mandalas can serve as an effective intervention for lowering anxiety levels among nursing staff working in the medical-surgical unit. By presenting evidence-based results, the study aims to support the use of this specific activity during breaks, suggesting it as a more beneficial alternative to other common break-time activities (Maguire, 2020).

Research & Design:
The study employs a mixed-methods research approach, which integrates both qualitative and quantitative research methodologies within a single study (Maguire, 2020). This approach allows the researcher to collect and analyze data using both qualitative and quantitative methods, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the research problem (Shorten & Smith, 2017; Wisdom & Creswell, 2013). By combining these methods, the study aims to offer a more robust and well-rounded analysis of the intervention's effectiveness.

The research design used in this study is a quasi-experimental design, which incorporates both pre-test and post-test elements (Maguire, 2020). The primary goal of a quasi-experimental design is to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between the independent and dependent variables. However, this design does not utilize random assignment of participants, which is a key difference from true experimental designs. Instead, it includes a comparison group that shares similar characteristics with the intervention group (White & Sabarwal, 2014; Schweizer, Braun, & Milstone, 2016).

Both the mixed-methods approach and the quasi-experimental design effectively support the purpose of the study. The mixed-methods approach allows for the collection of both qualitative and quantitative data, providing a comprehensive evidence base to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. The quasi-experimental design is particularly useful in this study because the participants were not randomly selected. This design also enables the researchers to make comparisons between the pre-test and post-test phases, thereby helping to establish whether the intervention had a significant impact on reducing anxiety levels.
