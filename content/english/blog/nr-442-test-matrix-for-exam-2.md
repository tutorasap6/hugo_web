### Legislation Related to Health Care

* Factors Influencing Legislation:
  * Legislation in healthcare is influenced by a variety of factors, including political climate, economic conditions, social dynamics, and technological advancements.
  * Public health emergencies, societal needs, and lobbying by interest groups also play significant roles in shaping health policies and laws.
* Government's Role in Health Policy at Local, State, and National Levels:
  * Local Level:
    * Local health departments (LHDs) focus on community health by implementing programs tailored to local needs, funded by state allocations and local taxes, sometimes supplemented by federal funds.
    * LHDs work closely with local officials, businesses, and community stakeholders to address public health issues and report communicable diseases to state health departments.
  * State Level:
    * State health departments receive funding from state legislatures and federal agencies, manage key programs like WIC and CHIP, and are responsible for public health policy and Medicaid administration.
    * State boards of nursing oversee the Nurse Practice Act, licensure, and nursing education.
  * Federal Level:
    * The United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) administers most health-related activities at the federal level, with a focus on national health priorities, and is funded through federal taxes.
    * The Veterans Health Administration provides healthcare services to military personnel and their dependents.
  * National Level:
    * The World Health Organization (WHO) provides international health information, sets standards for antibiotics and vaccines, and focuses on global health concerns like infectious diseases, maternal and child health, and primary care.
* Key Legislative Acts:
  * Hill-Burton Act: Provided federal funds for hospital construction, with a requirement to provide care to underserved populations.
  * COBRA (Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act): Allows individuals to continue health insurance coverage after employment ends.
  * Social Security Act: Established Social Security and later amendments introduced Medicare and Medicaid, providing healthcare for the elderly and low-income populations.

  * Private Policy: Developed by non-governmental organizations, including private companies, focusing on specific groups or health issues, often driven by business interests.
* Nurse’s Role in Policy:
  * Nurses play a key role in advocating for health policy changes at all levels—local, state, and national—by participating in policy development, education, and advocacy efforts to improve health outcomes.
* Role of Philanthropy and Volunteer Agencies:
  * These organizations contribute significantly to healthcare funding and policy development, often stepping in where government resources are limited, and supporting various health initiatives.
