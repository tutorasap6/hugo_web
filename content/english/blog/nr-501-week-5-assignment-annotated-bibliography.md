Theoretical Basis for Advanced Nursing Practice

Advanced nursing practice relies on a robust theoretical foundation to guide and enhance patient care. The integration of nursing theories into practice not only improves patient outcomes but also elevates the professional standards of nursing. This essay delves into the application of the Health Belief Model, Social Cognitive Theory, and Family Systems Theory in advanced nursing practice, highlighting their significance and practical implications.

### Health Belief Model

The Health Belief Model (HBM) is a psychological model that attempts to explain and predict health behaviors by focusing on the attitudes and beliefs of individuals. It was originally developed in the 1950s by social psychologists Hochbaum, Rosenstock, and Kegels working in the U.S. Public Health Service. The HBM is based on the understanding that a person will take a health-related action if that person feels that a negative health condition can be avoided, has a positive expectation that by taking a recommended action, they will avoid a negative health condition, and believes that they can successfully take a recommended health action.

Application in Nursing Practice

Cengiz, Bahar, and Canda (2020) conducted a study on the effects of patient care results of applied nursing intervention to individuals with stoma according to the Health Belief Model. The study revealed that the HBM could significantly influence patients' adaptation to new health conditions, such as living with a stoma. By addressing perceived barriers and enhancing perceived benefits, nurses can help patients adjust to new health regimes more effectively. This approach can be extended to various health conditions, ensuring that patients receive comprehensive care that addresses both their physical and psychological needs.

### Social Cognitive Theory

Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), developed by Albert Bandura, emphasizes the importance of observational learning, imitation, and modeling. SCT posits that people learn not only through their own experiences but also by observing the actions of others and the results of those actions.

Application in Nursing Practice

Irvine et al. (2019) explored the self-regulatory behaviors of undergraduate nursing students learning to teach from a social cognitive perspective. The study demonstrated that self-regulated learning, a core component of SCT, is crucial for nursing students. By fostering an environment that encourages peer learning and self-efficacy, nursing educators can enhance students' learning experiences and prepare them for future professional challenges.

### Family Systems Theory

Family Systems Theory (FST) views the family as an emotional unit and uses systems thinking to describe the complex interactions within it. This theory posits that individuals cannot be understood in isolation from one another but rather as a part of their family, as the family is an emotional unit.

Application in Nursing Practice

Looman (2019) emphasized the importance of systems thinking in advanced family nursing practice. The Family Nursing Assessment and Intervention Map (FN-AIM) was introduced as a tool to help nursing students develop family-based interventions. This approach enables nurses to consider the family as a whole and address health issues comprehensively, thereby improving both individual and family health outcomes.

### Conclusion

Incorporating nursing theories such as the Health Belief Model, Social Cognitive Theory, and Family Systems Theory into advanced nursing practice is essential for delivering holistic and effective patient care. These theories provide a framework for understanding patients' behaviors, developing effective interventions, and promoting overall well-being. As nursing continues to evolve, the integration of these theoretical models will remain pivotal in advancing the profession and improving patient outcomes.
