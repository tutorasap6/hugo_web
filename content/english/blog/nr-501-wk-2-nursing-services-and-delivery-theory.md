In this paper, I will discuss the practice theory known as the Nursing Services and Delivery Theory. According to Sagar (2012), the quality of nursing services has been a persistent challenge, primarily due to a global shortage of healthcare professionals. However, decision-makers have identified key intervention areas aimed at addressing this issue. By implementing changes in policies and regulations, this crisis can be mitigated. The International Council of Nurses highlights that nursing services often arise from contract employment (Sagar, 2012). To achieve quality service delivery, health organization managers, human resources, policymakers, and organizational structures must collaborate effectively.

Despite challenges in integrating the Nursing Services and Delivery Theory into real-life quality service delivery, organizations have managed to do so through advanced managerial skills. This theory encompasses four levels of conceptual models: nursing administrative practices and healthcare systems administrative practices. It addresses the efficiency and effectiveness of nursing service administrative practice and service delivery. The theory aims to understand the nature of organizations and then integrates nursing design and the framework of nursing work (Sagar, 2012).

Development and Application of the Nursing Services and Delivery Theory

According to Sagar (2012), the Nursing Services and Delivery Theory emerged from the demand for a new theoretical framework combining organizational, clinical, and financial variables from a nursing perspective. Historically, nursing staff used rudimentary methods to determine the nursing resources needed for service delivery. However, contemporary practices have adopted this theory to better align nursing services with organizational goals.

In countries like Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom, many healthcare organizations have successfully implemented this delivery theory. It links outcomes and staffing practices by alerting management to issues related to nursing service delivery. In the USA, a review of funded service delivery research in health organizations found that healthcare organizations and delivery models are the frameworks used to examine nursing performance (Sagar, 2012).

Importance of the Nursing Services and Delivery Theory

The Nursing Services and Delivery Theory offers numerous advantages to the nursing profession. It enhances nursing practices through training workshops and seminars, ensuring that its principles and guidelines are applied to deliver the best services to patients in various settings, including nursing homes, hospices, and home care. This theory provides a structured approach to improving the quality of nursing services, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.

By focusing on the integration of nursing administrative practices and healthcare systems administrative practices, the theory promotes a comprehensive understanding of how organizational dynamics affect nursing services. This holistic approach allows for more effective management of nursing resources, ensuring that patient care is both efficient and effective.

Conclusion

The Nursing Services and Delivery Theory is a vital framework for enhancing the quality of nursing services. By addressing the efficiency and effectiveness of nursing service administrative practices, this theory provides a structured approach to improving patient care. Through collaboration among health organization managers, human resources, policymakers, and organizational structures, the challenges in nursing service delivery can be effectively addressed. This theory's implementation has shown positive results in countries like Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom, demonstrating its value in the nursing profession.
