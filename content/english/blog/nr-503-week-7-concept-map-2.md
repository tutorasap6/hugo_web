Creating the Caring Environment for achieving quality health outcomes

 

Reflection on achievement of outcomes Concept Map

 

NR 503: Population Health Epidemiology and Statistical Principles 

 

What is the study of population epidemiology?

 

Population and epidemiology studies involve studying the health of populations—both at specific time points and over longer periods of time—to uncover patterns, trends, and outcomes that may be applicable to the general population.

 

What is the difference between epidemiology and population health?

 

Epidemiology is the study of factors that cause illness and impairment in human populations. It is the cornerstone of population health and clinical research, informing policy, prevention, disease treatment, and understanding of disease mechanisms.

 

Why is the study of epidemiology important?

 

Epidemiology is the study of how often diseases occur in different groups of people and why. Epidemiological information is used to plan and evaluate strategies to prevent illness and as a guide to the management of patients in whom disease has already developed.

 

What is the role of epidemiology in researching and addressing population health challenges?

 

Epidemiology offers insight into why disease and injury afflict some people more than others, and why they occur more frequently in some locations and times than in others— knowledge necessary for finding the most effective ways to prevent and treat health problems.

 

On Week 1 : Discussion of health disparities 

 

Health disparities are preventable differences in the burden of disease, injury, violence, or opportunities to achieve optimal health that are experienced by socially disadvantaged populations.

 

What is the goal of addressing disparities in health?

 

AMA's policy to reduce health care disparities

 

The American Medical Association (AMA) encourages physicians to examine their own practices to ensure equality in medical care. The AMA's mission is to achieve health equity by mitigating disparity factors in the patient population. Helping ensure equal access to health care.

These policies aim to: Increase awareness of racial and ethnic disparities in health care among the general public. Strengthen patient-provider relationships in publicly funded health plans.

 

On Week 2: Healthy People 2020 Impact

 

The overarching goals of Healthy People 2020 are to: attain high-quality, longer lives free of preventable disease, disability, injury, and premature death; achieve health equity, eliminate disparities, and improve the health of all groups; create social and physical environments that promote good health for all.

 

What else has changed since Healthy People 2020?

 

What else has changed since Healthy People 2020? A new decade means new opportunities to improve health and well-being across the nation. This decade, Healthy People 2030 features a smaller set of objectives with: More rigorous data standards.

 

On Week 3: Reading chapter 4 which is about Applying Epidemiological methods in population based nursing practice.

 

How epidemiology is applied in nursing practice?

 

The information is gathered from census data, vital statistics, and reportable disease records. Nurse epidemiologists identify people or populations at high risk; monitor the progress of diseases; specify areas of health care need; determine priorities, size, and scope of programs; and evaluate their impact.

 

What are the applications of epidemiology in public health practice?

 

Epidemiological methods are used for disease surveillance to identify which hazards are the most important. Epidemiological studies are also used to identify risk factors which may represent critical control points in the food production system.

 

What are the methods of epidemiology in community health nursing?

 

The three major epidemiologic techniques are descriptive, analytic, and experimental. Although all three can be used in investigating the occurrence of disease, the method used most is descriptive epidemiology.

 

 

 

Next is Clinical Prevention and Population health for improvement of health of the people

 

Week 4 :  Also evaluation of Practice at the Population Level.

 

What is the population based practice of the public health nurse?

 

The goal of population-based nursing is to provide evidence-based care to targeted groups of people with similar needs in order to improve outcomes. Population-based nursing uses a defined population or aggregate as the organizing unit for care.

 

What examines opportunities for nursing intervention at the population level?

 

Milio's framework for prevention (1976) provides a complement to the HBM and a mechanism for directing attention upstream and examining opportunities for nursing intervention at the population level.

 

What are the examples of population based health services?

 

Population-based health services - Refer to interventions such as health promotion, disease surveillance, and vector control, which have population groups as recipients

 

Week 5 : Identifying outcomes

 

How do you identify health outcomes?

 

Health outcomes are defined as those events occurring as a result of an intervention. These may be measured clinically (physical examination, laboratory testing, imaging), self-reported, or observed (such as gait or movement fluctuations seen by a healthcare provider or caregiver).

 

What are clinical outcomes examples?

 

Typical examples of outcomes are cure, clinical worsening, and mortality. The primary outcome is the variable that is the most relevant to answer the research question. Ideally, it should be patient-centered (i.e., an outcome that matters to patients, such as quality of life and survival).

 

Week 6 : Epidemiological analysis

 

What is an epidemiological analysis?

 

Epidemiology is used to describe the distribution of diseases in the population and to analyze the causes of these diseases. One important objective is to identify risk factors and to quantify their significance. A risk factor can influence the probability that a specific disease develops.

 

Why is epidemiological analysis important?

 

Epidemiology is the study of how often diseases occur in different groups of people and why. Epidemiological information is used to plan and evaluate strategies to prevent illness and as a guide to the management of patients in whom disease has already developed.

 

What are the methods of epidemiology analysis?

 

The three major epidemiologic techniques are descriptive, analytic, and experimental. Although all three can be used in investigating the occurrence of disease, the method used most is descriptive epidemiology.

 

Week 7 : Infectious disease paper

 

Your healthcare provider usually diagnoses infectious diseases using one or more lab tests. Your provider can look for signs of disease by: Swabbing your nose or throat. Getting blood, pee (urine), poop (stool) or spit (saliva) samples.

 

What are the 10 common infectious diseases?

 

Infectious diseases can be any of the following:

* Chickenpox.
* Common cold.
* Diphtheria.
* E. coli.
* Giardiasis.
* HIV/AIDS.
* Infectious mononucleosis.
* Influenza (flu)

Applying evidence at the Population level

 

What are the levels of evidence in nursing practice?

 

Level I: Meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs); experimental studies; RCTs. Level II: Quasi-experimental studies. Level III: Non-experimental or qualitative studies. Level IV: Opinions of nationally recognized experts based on research evidence or an expert consensus panel.

 

What is evidence based practice and improving population health?

 

The practice of evidence-based public health (EBPH) is an integration of science-based interventions with community preferences for improving population health (1). The concept of EBPH evolved at the same time as discourse on evidence-based practice in the disciplines of medicine, nursing, psychology, and social work.

 

How do you apply evidence in nursing practice?

 

Acquire: Search for relevant evidence to answer questions. Appraise: Determine whether or not the evidence is high-quality and valuable. Apply: Make clinical decisions utilizing the best available evidence. Assess: Evaluate the outcome of applying the evidence to the patient's situation.

 

How to use evidence-based practice to improve patient care?

 

These protocols can be divided into seven steps.

1. Create a spirit of inquiry.
2. Ask questions in a "PICO(T)" format - Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, (sometimes) Time.
3. Gather the most relevant evidence possible.
4. Appraise the evidence.
5. Integrate the best evidence with clinical expertise and patient preferences.

How does evidence-based practice ensure patient centered care patient safety and improve patient outcomes?

 

Evidence-based practice is a widely used problem-solving approach in the clinical setting, but it's also crucial to delivering patient-centered care. It integrates clinical expertise with the latest and best research evidence, along with known patient values, in order to deliver the best possible patient care.

Step by step explanation:
