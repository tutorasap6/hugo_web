NR 505 Week 5 Research Literature Design Sampling and Implementation 

To successfully complete the Week 5 assignment in the NR505 Advanced Research Methods: Evidence-Based Practice course, students will continue developing their MSN Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) scholarly project. This assignment builds on the work done in Week 2, where students identified a nursing concern and developed a PICOT or PICo question. The focus of this assignment is on discussing the research-based literature that supports the selected nursing concern, identifying an appropriate research design, explaining the sampling method, and discussing the implementation process using a change model.

## A SAMPLE PAPER

### Week 5: Research Literature, Design, Sampling, and Implementation

### PICOT/PICo Question:

For adolescents (ages 13-17), does the implementation of an HPV educational program result in a 25% increase in vaccination rates within one year compared to current practices?

### Nursing Concern:

The identified nursing concern is the low rate of HPV vaccination among adolescents, which increases their risk of developing HPV-related cancers. Addressing this concern is crucial for promoting long-term health and reducing the incidence of preventable diseases.

***

### 1. Research Literature Support:

To provide a comprehensive background for the identified concern and PICOT question, a review of relevant research studies is conducted. Below are summaries of ten key research articles that support the need for an HPV educational program to increase vaccination rates among adolescents.

* Limitation: Limited to one geographical area.

Article 4: Javid et al. (2016)

* Purpose: To identify barriers and facilitators to HPV vaccine uptake in Texas pediatric care settings.
* Research Approach: Qualitative survey method.
* Data Collection Methods: Surveys conducted via the Qualtrics platform.
* Results: Communication issues and misconceptions about HPV were significant barriers.
* Strength: Large-scale survey provides broad insights.
* Limitation: Response rate and potential selection bias were not clearly determined.

Article 5: Kasting et al. (2016)

* Purpose: To explore healthcare providers' awareness and informational needs regarding the nine-valent HPV vaccine.
* Research Approach: Qualitative, semi-structured interviews.
* Data Collection Methods: Recorded interviews with healthcare providers.

### 2. Research Approach and Design:

The research approach for this EBP project will be quantitative, focusing on numerical data to assess the effectiveness of the HPV educational program in increasing vaccination rates. A pretest-posttest design will be employed, where vaccination rates before and after the implementation of the educational program will be compared. This design is appropriate because it allows for the measurement of change over time and can establish a cause-effect relationship between the intervention and the outcome.

### 3. Sampling Method:

The sampling method for this project will be stratified random sampling. Adolescents aged 13-17 from multiple schools in the target area will be stratified based on age, gender, and previous vaccination status. This method ensures that all relevant subgroups are adequately represented in the sample, leading to more generalizable results.

### 4. Implementation and Change Model:

The implementation of this EBP project will be guided by the Iowa Model of Evidence-Based Practice to Promote Quality Care. This model emphasizes the importance of identifying a problem, forming a team, gathering and appraising evidence, piloting the practice change, and evaluating the outcomes.

Steps of Implementation:

1. Form a Multidisciplinary Team: A team comprising nurses, school health officials, and public health educators will be formed.
2. Gather and Appraise Evidence: The team will review the existing literature on HPV vaccination and educational interventions.
3. Develop the Educational Program: Based on the evidence, an HPV educational program tailored to adolescents and their parents will be developed.
4. Pilot the Program: The program will be piloted in a few selected schools, and feedback will be collected.
5. Evaluate Outcomes: Vaccination rates before and after the program will be compared to assess the effectiveness of the intervention.
6. Disseminate Findings: The results will be shared with stakeholders, including healthcare providers and policymakers, to encourage broader adoption.

### Conclusion:

This assignment has outlined the research literature, design, sampling, and implementation plan for an EBP project aimed at increasing HPV vaccination rates among adolescents. The selected research studies provide robust support for the project, and the use of a quantitative approach with stratified random sampling and the Iowa Model will ensure the project's success.
