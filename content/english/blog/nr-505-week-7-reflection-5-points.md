NR 505 Week 7 reflection 5 points

This weekâ€™s learning experience has been particularly enlightening as I delved into the various methods of disseminating evidence-based practice (EBP) findings. Among the types of dissemination, presenting at professional conferences appeals to me the most. The dynamic nature of conferences, where professionals gather to share cutting-edge research, provides an excellent platform for engaging discussions and receiving immediate feedback. It also allows for networking with other experts in the field, which can lead to collaborative opportunities and further dissemination of the research findings. The interactive environment of a conference presentation, combined with the ability to reach a targeted audience, makes it a compelling option for me.

To share the results of my Week 7 project in a professional setting, I would begin by preparing a concise and impactful abstract to submit to relevant conferences or professional journals. Additionally, I would consider creating a poster presentation or a PowerPoint deck that effectively communicates the key findings and implications of my project. Engaging with colleagues in my workplace and discussing the potential implementation of the EBP change in our practice setting would be another step. This could involve organizing a departmental meeting or workshop where I could present my findings and discuss the practical applications and benefits of the proposed changes. By taking these steps, I can ensure that my work reaches a broader audience and contributes to the advancement of nursing practice.
