### NR 506 Week 2 Policy Priority Selection

Dr. Parker and Class,

I completely understand where you’re coming from. Policies and politics can be overwhelming, especially when they aren’t areas we’re passionate about. Nutrition in schools, however, is a fantastic topic to focus on, especially given the current concerns surrounding childhood obesity. With six kids of your own, you have firsthand experience in understanding the importance of healthy eating habits, and you’re likely seeing the impact of school lunches on their overall nutrition.

You’re absolutely right in pointing out that good nutrition in schools is a crucial defense against childhood obesity. It’s alarming that more than one-third of children in the U.S. are overweight, which underscores the need for schools to serve meals that are both nutritious and appealing to children (Bratskeir, 2015).

The comparison you’ve made between school lunches in the U.S. and those in other countries highlights a significant issue. For example, the typical lunch in the U.S., such as fried "popcorn" chicken with mashed potatoes, peas, a fruit cup, and a chocolate chip cookie, doesn’t quite measure up nutritionally to what children are eating in countries like Brazil or Finland. In Brazil, a school lunch might consist of pork with mixed veggies, black beans and rice, salad, bread, and baked plantains— a meal that’s not only healthier but also provides a more balanced variety of nutrients. Similarly, in Finland, children might enjoy pea soup, beet salad, carrot salad, bread, and pannakkau (a dessert pancake) with fresh berries, which is both nutritious and culturally enriching (Bratskeir, 2015).

This disparity is something worth addressing in policy discussions. Perhaps focusing on how schools in the U.S. can improve their meal programs by learning from the approaches of other countries could be a compelling direction for your work in this class. Encouraging policy changes that emphasize whole foods, culturally diverse meals, and fresh ingredients could make a significant impact on the health of children across the nation.

Good luck with your project, and remember that your personal experiences and insights are valuable contributions to the conversation on school nutrition.

Best regards,
\[Your Name]
