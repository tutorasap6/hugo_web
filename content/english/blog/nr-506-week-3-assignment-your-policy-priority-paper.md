### Policy Priority Issue: Smoking Cessation for School-Aged Children

Introduction:Smoking is a critical public health issue, especially among youth. Despite widespread awareness of its dangers, smoking remains the leading cause of preventable death. This paper focuses on implementing smoking cessation programs in schools, particularly targeting middle and high school students, to prevent the onset of smoking in adulthood.

Key Points:

* Smoking Statistics and Impact:
  * Smoking causes 480,000 deaths annually in the U.S., with 42,000 of those due to secondhand smoke.
  * Approximately 16 million Americans suffer from smoking-related diseases.
  * Diseases caused by smoking include cardiovascular disease, cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and more (CDC, 2016; Abikoye, Kashimawo, & Eze, 2013).
* Target Population:
  * Focus on school-aged children, especially those in middle and high school.
  * Statistics show that 26.6% of high school seniors reported smoking a tobacco product in the past 30 days (Netemeyer, Burton, Andrews, & Kees, 2016).
  * Most adult smokers began smoking before the age of 18.
* Policy Strategy:
  * Develop and implement school-based programs that are tailored to different age groups.
  * Programs should be age-appropriate and evolve as students progress through school.
  * Emphasize interactive and engaging methods that go beyond traditional lectures to address smoking risks.

### 2. Empirical Evidence Supporting the Policy

Importance of Early Education:

* Research indicates that early and continuous education about the dangers of smoking can significantly reduce the likelihood of children picking up the habit.
* Starting antismoking education in preschool helps children internalize the risks associated with smoking from a young age.

Challenges with Current Approaches:

* Current antismoking campaigns may not be resonating with teenagers, as evidenced by the significant percentage of high school seniors who still report smoking.
* Repetition without innovation can lead to desensitization, suggesting the need for fresh, creative approaches to education.

### 3. Proposed Implementation

Role of the School Board:

* The involvement of school board leaders, such as David Scanga, Area Superintendent of Central Pasco County, is crucial in the successful implementation of these programs.
* School boards can facilitate the integration of antismoking programs into the existing curriculum and ensure that they are consistently reinforced throughout a childâ€™s education.

Program Components:

* Preschool Level: Introduction to healthy habits and basic concepts of the harms of smoking through stories, games, and activities.
* Elementary Level: More structured lessons that involve interactive discussions, age-appropriate literature, and role-playing scenarios to help children understand the long-term consequences of smoking.
* Middle School Level: At this stage, students can engage in deeper discussions about peer pressure, media influence, and the social implications of smoking. Programs should include testimonials from former smokers, interactive workshops, and creative projects.
* High School Level: Focus on the science behind addiction, detailed health risks, and societal impacts of smoking. Incorporate debates, research projects, and community involvement activities that encourage students to advocate against smoking.

### 4. Conclusion

Policy Impact:

* Effective antismoking education in schools has the potential to drastically reduce the number of future smokers.
* By starting early and adapting education methods to be more engaging and relevant to each developmental stage, schools can play a pivotal role in preventing smoking among youth.

Next Steps:

* Engage with school board members and other stakeholders to present the evidence supporting the need for revamped antismoking programs.
* Pilot the programs in selected schools within Central Pasco County and monitor their effectiveness, with the aim of scaling them up across the state.

In summary, smoking cessation education tailored to school-aged children, starting from preschool and intensifying through middle and high school, is crucial in combating smoking initiation among youth. The support of school board leaders, like David Scanga, is essential in implementing these programs and ensuring they have the desired impact on reducing smoking rates among future generations.
