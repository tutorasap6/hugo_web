NR 507 Study Guide

### Chapters 1-5, 11-14, 16-20, 21-25, 27-33, 34-39, 40-47

1. Types of Immunity
   * Innate Immunity: First line of defense, non-specific, includes physical barriers like skin and mucous membranes, and immune cells like macrophages.
   * Adaptive/Acquired Immunity: Specific immunity developed after exposure to antigens, includes humoral (B cells) and cell-mediated (T cells) responses.
   * Reference: Chapter 7, pg. 191
2. Alveolar Ventilation/Perfusion
   * Concepts: The relationship between the air reaching the alveoli (ventilation) and the blood reaching the alveoli via capillaries (perfusion). The V/Q ratio is crucial for efficient gas exchange.
   * Reference: Chapter 34, pg. 1238
3. Dermatologic Conditions
   * Pityriasis Rosea: A common, self-limiting skin condition, characterized by a “herald patch” followed by a widespread rash. Often resolves within weeks to months.
   * Reference: Chapter 46, pg. 1630-1631
4. Croup
   * Description: A viral infection common in children, leading to a barking cough, stridor, and hoarseness due to inflammation of the larynx and trachea.
   * Reference: Chapter 36, pg. 1294
5. Types of Anemia
   * Macrocytic Anemia: Characterized by large red blood cells (e.g., Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency).
   * Microcytic Anemia: Characterized by small red blood cells (e.g., Iron deficiency anemia, thalassemia).
   * Normocytic Anemia: Normal-sized red blood cells but low in number (e.g., Anemia of chronic disease, aplastic anemia).
   * Reference: Chapter 28, pg. 987-1002
6. The Inflammatory Process Upon Injury
   * Steps: Vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, migration of leukocytes, phagocytosis, and resolution. Key mediators include histamines, prostaglandins, and cytokines.
   * Reference: Chapter 7
7. GI Symptoms Resulting in Heartburn
   * Conditions: GERD, hiatal hernia, and peptic ulcer disease. Symptoms include burning chest pain, regurgitation, and sometimes chronic cough or laryngitis.
   * Reference: Chapter 41, pg. 1429-1466
8. Pulmonary Terminology
   * Dyspnea: Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.
   * Orthopnea: Difficulty breathing when lying flat.
   * Tachypnea: Rapid breathing.
   * Reference: Chapter 35, pg. 1249
9. Complications of Gastric Resection Surgery
   * Dumping Syndrome: Rapid gastric emptying causing symptoms like diarrhea, dizziness, and hypoglycemia. Malabsorption of nutrients can also occur.
   * Reference: Chapter 41, pg. 1439
10. Dermatology Terminology
    * Macules: Flat, distinct, discolored areas of skin.
    * Nevi (Moles): Benign skin growths, usually pigmented.
    * Papules: Small raised bumps on the skin.
    * Reference: Chapter 46, pg. 1620
11. Chicken Pox (Varicella)
    * Characteristics: Highly contagious viral infection causing an itchy rash and red spots or blisters all over the body.
    * Reference: Chapter 46, pg. 1659
12. Maternal Immune System
    * Adaptations: Immune system modulation during pregnancy to prevent rejection of the fetus while maintaining the ability to fight infections.
    * Reference: Chapters 8 & 9, pg. 259-276
13. Candidiasis Exacerbation
    * Description: Overgrowth of Candida, often exacerbated by factors like antibiotic use, immunosuppression, or diabetes.
    * Reference: Chapter 10, pg. 313
14. Carbuncles
    * Description: Deep skin infection involving a group of hair follicles, causing a swollen, red, and painful cluster of boils.
    * Reference: Chapter 46, pg. 1635
15. Anemia Terminology
    * Hypochromic: Pale red blood cells, typically associated with iron deficiency.
    * Macrocytic: Larger-than-normal red blood cells, often seen in Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency.
    * Microcytic: Smaller-than-normal red blood cells, often due to iron deficiency.
    * Reference: Chapter 28, pg. 983
16. Antibodies (Immunoglobulins)
    * IgG: Most abundant antibody in the body, providing long-term protection.
    * IgA: Found in mucous membranes, protecting against pathogens.
    * IgM: First antibody produced in response to an infection.
    * Reference: Chapter 8, pg. 229
17. Skin Cancer
    * Types: Basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. Risk factors include UV exposure and genetic predisposition.
    * Reference: Chapter 46, pg. 1641
18. Parts of the Heart and Their Functions
    * Pericardium: The fibrous sac surrounding the heart, protecting it and reducing friction during heartbeats.
    * Myocardium: The muscular layer responsible for pumping blood.
    * Endocardium: The inner lining of the heart chambers and valves.
    * Reference: Chapter 31, pg. 1085
19. Congenital Heart Defects
    * Common Defects: Ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, and tetralogy of Fallot. These defects can lead to abnormal blood flow within the heart.
    * Reference: Chapter 33, pg. 1200
20. GI Symptoms of Various Conditions
    * Pyloric Stenosis: Causes projectile vomiting in infants due to narrowing of the pylorus.
    * Hiatal Hernia: Part of the stomach pushes through the diaphragm, leading to GERD-like symptoms.
    * Ulcerative Colitis: Chronic inflammatory bowel disease causing abdominal pain, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding.
