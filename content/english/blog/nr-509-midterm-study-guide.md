## NR 509 Midterm Study Guide

### General Study Tips and Recommendations

* Focus and Repetition: Topics and content on guides are intended to focus student attention when reading/studying. Some topics may be repeated in multiple chapters to reinforce learning.
* Depth of Understanding: Multiple test items are derived from the same topic areas to encourage deeper comprehension. Students must have a broad understanding of the content and not simply memorize passages in textbooks or articles.
* Key Information: Information in red letters in the chapters, as well as tables and appendices at the end of the chapters, may include test items.
* Cognitive Levels: Exam questions represent various levels of cognitive learning. Students are expected to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate patient scenarios to answer questions effectively.
* Reading Strategy: Read all of the answers BEFORE reading the stem of the question. This helps focus on the key content and avoids distractions by extraneous information.
* Techniques of Examination and Recording Findings: Be familiar with these sections for all body system chapters in the textbook.
