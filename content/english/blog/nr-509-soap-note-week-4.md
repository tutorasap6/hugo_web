***

Plan:

Diagnostics:

* Lipid Panel, Fasting (LDL, HDL, Cholesterol, Triglycerides): Evaluate levels of lipids/cholesterol in blood for medication adjustment if necessary, to prevent further atherosclerosis
* CK/ CK-MB Blood Test: Tests for elevated Creatine kinase in the blood, indicating muscle damage; CK-MB test more specifically for heart muscle damage
* Troponin Blood Test: Elevated blood levels can indicate heart injury

Medications:

* Continue Previous Medications as Prescribed
* Aspirin (Bayer): 81 mg PO QD, long-term, continuous
* Nitroglycerin: 0.3 mg pill sublingual q5min; maximum 3 doses within 15 minutes, PRN

Referral/Consults:

* Cardiology: Consultation for further evaluation of heart disease, angina, and sclerosis; potential for additional testing such as stress test/heart cath

Education:

* Utilize nitroglycerin for chest pain not resolved by rest
* Decrease fats in diet, reduce red meat and fast food intake
* Monitor weight daily, notify physician of significant changes or swelling

Follow-Up:

* Follow-up within four to six months unless symptoms worsen; call the office for changes in physical activity, symptoms, adverse effects of medication, or new chronic conditions
* Seek immediate medical attention for continuous chest pain not relieved by nitroglycerin, or worsening symptoms affecting breathing or spreading to limbs
