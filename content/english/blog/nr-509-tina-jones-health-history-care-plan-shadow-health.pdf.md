### Care Plan

Short-Term Goal: To have Tina confirm verbally that her pain is reduced to an agreed-upon level (less than 4/10) within two hours.

Interventions:

1. Administer pain medication as per provider order.
2. Advise Tina to call for assistance with ambulation after taking opioid pain medication.
3. Apply intermittent heat/cold packs on Tina's right foot.
4. Educate Tina on the side effects of pain medication.
5. Encourage Tina to call for assistance if experiencing side effects and/or pain above 4/10.
6. Provide distractions from pain through television, reading material, and/or music.
7. Recommend intermittent repositioning, and encourage Tina to ask for help with changing positions.

Intervention Rationale:The interventions aim to manage Tina's pain through both pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods. Educating Tina on medication side effects and involving her in her own care are essential for effective pain management.
