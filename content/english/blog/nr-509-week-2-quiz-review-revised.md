### NR 509 Week 2 Quiz Review

What does dullness when percussing lung fields indicate?
Dullness when percussing lung fields may indicate the presence of fluid or solid tissue within the lungs, such as in cases of pneumonia, pleural effusion, or a mass (Jarvis, pg 427).

Which cranial nerve controls facial sensation?
Facial sensation is controlled by the trigeminal nerve, also known as cranial nerve V (Jarvis, pg 283).

Which two salivary glands are accessible during an exam?
The two salivary glands accessible during an exam are the parotid glands and the submandibular glands.

What cranial nerve is being assessed when a patient shrugs their shoulders?
When a patient shrugs their shoulders, cranial nerve XI, the spinal accessory nerve, is being assessed (Jarvis, pg 646).

What muscles are being assessed when assessing cranial nerve XI (spinal accessory nerve)?
The muscles being assessed are the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles.

What concerns are there for malignant nodules versus benign lymph nodules?
Malignant nodules are typically hard, fixed, non-tender, and may grow rapidly, while benign lymph nodules are often soft, mobile, tender, and may fluctuate in size with infection.

What should you do next if you palpate a submental lymph node?
If you palpate a submental lymph node, you should further assess the surrounding areas, such as the floor of the mouth, to identify potential sources of infection or malignancy (Jarvis, pg 253).

Define visual acuity.
Visual acuity is the clarity or sharpness of vision, typically measured using a Snellen chart.

What should you do if your patient canâ€™t read the largest number on the Snellen chart?
If a patient cannot read the largest number on the Snellen chart, you should move the chart closer to the patient, record the distance at which they can read it, and/or use alternative methods such as counting fingers or hand movements (Jarvis, pg 289).

Example of good visual acuity:
An example of good visual acuity is 20/20 vision, meaning the patient can see at 20 feet what a person with normal vision can see at 20 feet (Jarvis, pg 289).

Example of poor visual acuity:
An example of poor visual acuity is 20/200 vision, meaning the patient can see at 20 feet what a person with normal vision can see at 200 feet (Jarvis, pg 289).

What is expected with corneal light reflex?
A normal corneal light reflex is when the light reflection appears symmetrically in both eyes, indicating proper alignment.

Know normal variances of sclera:
Normal variances of the sclera include slight yellowing in elderly patients or blue-tinged sclera in infants (Jarvis, pg 283).

How do you check for ptosis?
To check for ptosis, observe the upper eyelids for any drooping when the patient looks straight ahead (Jarvis, pg 292).

What does ptosis indicate?
Ptosis may indicate underlying conditions such as myasthenia gravis, oculomotor nerve dysfunction, or Horner's syndrome (Jarvis, pg 292).

Nasal fissure of a patient with chronic allergies:
A patient with chronic allergies may present with a nasal crease or fissure due to frequent nose rubbing (Jarvis, pg 271).

Acute allergies:
Acute allergies may present with swollen, red nasal mucosa and increased nasal discharge (Jarvis, pg 363).

What is an abnormal palpation of sinuses?
An abnormal palpation of sinuses includes tenderness or pain, which may indicate sinusitis (Jarvis, pg 362).

Normal palpation of sinuses:
Normal palpation of sinuses should be non-tender and without pain.

Know normal variations in the gingival margin:
Normal variations in the gingival margin include stippling, slight pigmentation, and firm texture.

What does a dehydrated oral cavity look like?
A dehydrated oral cavity appears dry, with cracked lips, and may have a sticky or thickened appearance of saliva (Jarvis, pg 387).

What is tactile fremitus, how do you test for it, and what does it indicate?
Tactile fremitus is the palpable vibration of the chest wall produced by the spoken voice. It is tested by placing the hands on the patient's chest and asking them to say "ninety-nine." Increased fremitus may indicate consolidation (e.g., pneumonia), while decreased fremitus may suggest an obstruction or pleural effusion (Jarvis, pg 425).
