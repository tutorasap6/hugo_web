### Question #1: Which of the following is associated with severe tinnitus?

Answer: Stroke.

Explanation: Severe tinnitus can be associated with a stroke, particularly if it is unilateral or occurs suddenly with other neurological symptoms. While depressive disorder, hypertension, and diabetic retinopathy may contribute to tinnitus, severe cases are more likely linked to acute events like a stroke (Møller, 2011).

### Question #2: How do most clients on traditional Medicare cover their out-of-pocket expenses?

Answer: Acquiring a secondary insurance plan.

Explanation: Traditional Medicare (Parts A and B) covers a substantial portion of healthcare costs, but it does not cover all expenses. Many clients on Medicare purchase a secondary insurance plan, such as a Medigap policy, to cover out-of-pocket expenses such as copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles (Kongstvedt, 2013).

### Question #3: Which of the following is true regarding atopic dermatitis?

Answer: The Cardinal sign is severe pruritus.

Explanation: Atopic dermatitis is characterized by intense itching (pruritus) as one of its cardinal signs. This itching often precedes the rash and can be severe, leading to scratching and further skin damage (Eichenfield et al., 2014).

### Question #4: A 16-year-old client presents to the clinic with right ear pain for two days following participation in a high school swim meet. The eardrum demonstrates tenderness with traction of the pinna and tragus pain, when pressure is applied. The ear canal is red and swollen to the point that the tympanic membrane cannot be visualized. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Answer: Otitis externa.

Explanation: The symptoms described—pain on traction of the pinna and tragus, redness, and swelling of the ear canal—are characteristic of otitis externa, commonly known as swimmer's ear. Otitis media typically presents with middle ear symptoms and is not typically associated with pain on manipulation of the outer ear (Monasta et al., 2012).

### Question #5: A 10-year-old client was prescribed amoxicillin for otitis media. The FNP receives a call from the parents that the client has developed a rash on the trunk. What is the most appropriate next activity by the FNP?

Answer: Stop the medication.

Explanation: A rash that develops after starting a new medication, such as amoxicillin, could indicate an allergic reaction. The most appropriate action would be to stop the medication and consult further for an appropriate treatment plan, which might include prescribing systemic antihistamines or steroids if needed (Bersoff-Matcha et al., 2017).

***

### Question #6: Which of the following statements regarding the client history is true?

Answer: History of present illness (HPI) is a detailed breakdown of the client's chief complaint.

Explanation: The History of Present Illness (HPI) provides a comprehensive account of the client's current health issue and its progression. Objective findings are reported in the physical examination and review of systems (ROS), while the OLDCART acronym helps in assessing the HPI (Harrison et al., 2018).

***

### Question #7: Which of the following individuals is at most risk for developing epiphora (excessive tearing)?

Answer: A 76-year-old with Type 2 diabetes.

Explanation: Epiphora, or excessive tearing, is often related to age-related changes and chronic conditions such as diabetes, which can affect the lacrimal glands and tear production. While other individuals might experience tearing due to various reasons, the elderly with chronic conditions like diabetes are at a higher risk (Michaud et al., 2012).

***

### Question #8: A client presents to the office with a complaint of skin irritation, redness, and tenderness on the back of his neck. Examination reveals a rubbery, smooth, and round mass of tissue. The mass is compressible and has a soft texture. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Answer: Lipoma.

Explanation: A lipoma is a benign, soft, and compressible subcutaneous mass of fatty tissue. It is often smooth, rubbery, and mobile under the skin. Other conditions like acrochordons (skin tags) and nevi (moles) have different characteristics (Tosti & Piraccini, 2013).

***

### Question #9: A complete blood count (CBC) may identify which of the following as a cause of tinnitus?

Answer: Anemia.

Explanation: Anemia can lead to tinnitus due to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues, including the inner ear. While thyroid disease, zinc deficiency, and hyperlipidemia might be associated with tinnitus, anemia is more directly identified through a CBC (Baguley, 2003).

***

### Question #10: A 45-year-old client with a history of a total thyroidectomy comes to the office concerned with a rash that has developed around a new tracheostomy site. Upon exam, the NP notes a papular rash with satellite lesions surrounding the stoma. What does this indicate?

Answer: Candidiasis.

Explanation: The presence of a papular rash with satellite lesions around a tracheostomy site suggests candidiasis, a fungal infection caused by Candida species. This type of infection is common in moist environments and can occur around medical devices like tracheostomy sites (Kull et al., 2013).
