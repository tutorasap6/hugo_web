### Assessment

Primary Diagnosis:

* Ureteral Calculus (Kidney Stone): The patient’s symptoms of severe, intermittent, throbbing back and abdominal pain that radiates to the groin, along with the presence of a 5mm calculus on ultrasound, are consistent with a diagnosis of ureteral calculus. The urinalysis findings of blood and WBCs further support this diagnosis.

Differential Diagnoses:

* Pyelonephritis: The presence of WBCs in the urinalysis suggests a possible urinary tract infection, but the lack of fever and systemic symptoms makes pyelonephritis less likely.
* Musculoskeletal Pain: Given the patient’s occupation as a plumber, musculoskeletal pain could be a consideration, but the characteristics and location of the pain are more suggestive of a renal origin.

***

### Plan

Diagnostic Testing:

* Consider a non-contrast CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis to further evaluate the size and location of the kidney stone and assess for any possible complications.

Medications:

* Pain Management: Prescribe NSAIDs such as ibuprofen for pain relief.
* Antiemetic: Prescribe an antiemetic such as ondansetron for nausea.
* Hydration: Encourage increased oral fluid intake to facilitate the passage of the stone.

Patient Education:

* Educate the patient on the importance of hydration and advise him to monitor his urine for any changes or the passage of the stone.
* Discuss potential symptoms that would require urgent follow-up, such as fever, worsening pain, or inability to urinate.

Follow-up:

* Arrange a follow-up appointment in 1-2 weeks or sooner if symptoms worsen, to reassess pain, check for the passage of the stone, and consider further intervention if needed.

Lifestyle Modifications:

* Encourage the patient to quit smoking and discuss the potential benefits of smoking cessation for overall health and kidney stone prevention.
