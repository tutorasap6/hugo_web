Question 1: A 29-year-old female just returned from Central America with traveler's diarrhea and presents to the clinic for evaluation. Which of the following is the best treatment?

* Correct Answer: Supportive care.
  Explanation: Traveler's diarrhea is often self-limiting, and the mainstay of treatment is supportive care, including hydration and electrolyte replacement. Antibiotics may be considered in severe cases or if the patient is immunocompromised.

Question 2: An 82-year-old female has been diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), chronic constipation, and diverticulosis following a colonoscopy. Which pharmacological agent should the clinician recommend?

* Correct Answer: Bulk laxative.
  Explanation: Bulk-forming laxatives, such as psyllium, are often recommended for managing chronic constipation, particularly in elderly patients, as they help to increase stool bulk and promote regular bowel movements.

Question 3: A 67-year-old female on multiple medications for chronic conditions was just diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). In teaching the patient about the disease, what medication should the clinician recommend that the patient refrain from using?

* Correct Answer: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
  Explanation: NSAIDs can exacerbate GERD symptoms by irritating the gastric mucosa and relaxing the lower esophageal sphincter, so they should be avoided or used with caution in patients with GERD.
