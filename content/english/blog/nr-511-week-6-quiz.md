   * Correct Answer: Ultrasound
2. A 51-year-old male requests a prescription for sildenafil (Viagra). He says that the only medication he takes is isosorbide mononitrate (Monoket) oral tablets and that he has diabetes which is controlled with diet alone. What should the nurse practitioner tell him?

4. A 72-year-old male presents to the office for follow-up of several episodes of orthostatic hypotension. After obtaining a review of systems and a digital rectal examination, it also appears that he has benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with lower urinary tract symptoms. The nurse practitioner reviews his recent ultrasound evaluation, which reports a prostate volume of over 40 mL, and the results of the American Urological Association (AUA) symptom index for BPH, which shows his score to be 12. Based on the preceding information and the patient's desire for noninvasive medical therapy, what management should he be offered?
   * Correct Answer: Finasteride
5. A 63-year-old man presents to your office with hematuria, hesitancy, and dribbling. Digital rectal examination (DRE) reveals a smooth, moderately enlarged prostate. The client's prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is 1.2. What is the most appropriate management strategy at this time?
   * Correct Answer: Prescribing an alpha-adrenergic blocker

On physical examination, the nurse practitioner notes tortuous veins posterior to and above the testes that extend up into the external inguinal ring. Based on the preceding assessment, the nurse practitioner refers the patient to urology with which diagnosis?
   * Correct Answer: Varicocele
8. A 62-year-old male has a low International Prostate Symptom Score for lower urinary tract symptoms associated with his benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The nurse practitioner should recommend:
   * Correct Answer: No treatment at this time
9. A 72-year-old unmarried, sexually active man presents to the clinic with complaints of hesitancy, urgency, and occasional uncontrolled dribbling. Although the nurse practitioner suspects benign prostatic hyperplasia, what else should the differential diagnosis include?
   * Correct Answer: Urethral stricture
10. A 32-year-old male presents with complaints of a scrotal mass; however, the scrotum is so edematous that it is difficult to assess. How would the nurse practitioner (NP) best determine whether the condition is a hernia or a hydrocele?
