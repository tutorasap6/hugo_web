Concept Analysis of Pain

### Introduction

The process of concept analysis is crucial for clarifying vague or poorly understood concepts within a theory, enabling the development of more precise operational definitions (Pierce, Perry, Gallagher & Chiarelli, 2015). According to Dinmohammadi, Peyrovi, & Mehrdad (2013), concept analysis provides a basic understanding of a concept's underlying attributes, helping to define problems clearly and allowing for the construction of hypotheses that accurately reflect the relationships between concepts in a theory. Robson & Troutman-Jordan (2014) further emphasize that concept analysis is useful for constructing research instruments or interview guides and refining ambiguous concepts in a theory.

In this paper, the nursing concept that will be analyzed is pain. Pain is a fundamental concept in Betty Neumanâ€™s Systems Model, where it is viewed as an intrapersonal stressor. The lack of a clear definition of pain presents challenges for both researchers studying pain and nurses providing pain relief to patients and their families. The purpose of this study is to clarify the concept of pain in nursing, gain a deeper understanding by defining and explaining pain control, explore pain through literature, and recognize its attributes, antecedents, and consequences within the context of nursing. This paper will also analyze the empirical referents and build model cases to explain the concept of pain as derived from the literature.

### Definition and Explanation of Pain

Pain is described as an unpleasant sensation associated with sensory and emotional experiences that can cause potential or actual tissue damage (Penprase et al., 2015). The Institute of Medicine (2012) asserts that "pain is always subjective; it is unquestionably a sensation in a part or parts of the body, but it is also always unpleasant and therefore also an emotional experience." The Collins English Dictionary (2014) defines pain as an unpleasant feeling resulting from injury or disease, usually localized to a specific part of the body, and/or mental and emotional distress or suffering.

Pain can be categorized as chronic or acute. Chronic pain is defined by Schofield et al. (2014) as pain that persists for longer than six months, continuing even after the underlying cause has healed. Acute pain, on the other hand, is described by Montgomery, Hall, & Keriazes (2015) as pain that comes on quickly, can be severe, but lasts for a relatively short duration. From a philosophical perspective, Leung (2012) explains that pain is always an internal, subjective sensation, which, despite numerical or graphical ratings, remains uniquely related to the individual experiencing it. Pain can also be understood as "whatever the experiencing person says it is, occurring whenever she/he states it does," emphasizing the highly personal and subjective nature of pain perception.

### Conclusion

This concept analysis of pain underscores the complexity and subjectivity inherent in defining and understanding pain within the nursing profession. By exploring the various definitions and perspectives on pain, this analysis aims to provide a clearer framework for nursing practice, research, and education related to pain management.
