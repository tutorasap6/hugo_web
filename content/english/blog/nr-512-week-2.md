### NR 512 week 2

As I have read the lesson and assigned reading for this week, I have concluded that wisdom and professional nursing judgment are very similar. Wisdom is the use of knowledge to deal with complex problems or human needs. It involves the use of knowledge, experience, insight, and understanding, and the application of this knowledge to solve human problems. Wisdom is not something that is acquired instantly; it is gained through experiences, which we build on to form our clinical judgments (Matney, Avant, & Staggers, 2016).

According to Benner, "nursing wisdom is based on clinical judgment and encompasses intuition, emotions, and senses" (Matney et al., 2016). In Benner's theory, From Novice to Expert, a novice is seen as a new graduate in the beginning stages of their learning. At this stage, the novice nurse relies heavily on rules and guidelines, often lacking the experience needed to apply knowledge to real-life situations effectively. As the nurse progresses to the advanced beginner stage, they begin to gain more hands-on experience and can provide adequate care, but may still struggle with associating knowledge from previous experiences to current practices.

In the competent level, the nurse now has a few years of experience and is able to apply their knowledge and skills more effectively. At this stage, nurses demonstrate a better understanding of patient care and clinical situations. They can plan and manage patient care with greater confidence and begin to see the bigger picture in patient care.

The proficient nurse, with even more experience, starts to view situations as a whole rather than in parts. They can recognize patterns in clinical situations and respond intuitively to changes in patient conditions. This level of understanding allows proficient nurses to anticipate potential complications and intervene more effectively.

Finally, the expert nurse, who has accumulated extensive experience, operates with a deep and intuitive understanding of clinical situations. Expert nurses often rely on their intuition and tacit knowledge to make swift, effective decisions in complex situations. They are able to see the subtle signs and symptoms that others might miss and can make decisions based on a wealth of experience, often without needing to rely on rules or guidelines.

In essence, wisdom in nursing is not just about having knowledge; it is about the ability to apply that knowledge in a way that benefits patients. It involves recognizing the nuances of different situations, understanding the complexities of human needs, and using one's experience to make informed and compassionate decisions. As nurses progress through their careers, moving from novice to expert, they build the wisdom necessary to provide high-quality care, drawing on both their clinical skills and their ability to empathize with and understand the needs of their patients.

In conclusion, wisdom and professional nursing judgment are indeed closely related, as both involve the thoughtful application of knowledge and experience to solve complex human problems. As nurses develop through the various stages of their careers, they gain the wisdom necessary to provide compassionate, effective care, which ultimately enhances patient outcomes and contributes to the overall quality of healthcare.
