***

### WEEK 1: Major Antibiotic Drug Classes

#### Key Areas to Focus On:

* Contraindications and High-Risk Patients: Understand the conditions or patient populations where certain antibiotics should be avoided.
* Examples of Major Antibiotic Drug Classes: Know the commonly used antibiotics in each class (e.g., Penicillins, Cephalosporins, Macrolides).
* Monitoring Needs: Be familiar with what needs to be monitored when using specific antibiotics (e.g., kidney function, liver enzymes).
* Renal Dosing Adjustments: Identify which antibiotics require dose adjustments in renal impairment and the extent of adjustment (e.g., 25%, 50%).
* Patient Education: Provide education on proper use, potential side effects, and when to seek medical attention.
* Lifespan Considerations: Understand the safety of antibiotics during pregnancy, breastfeeding, and in pediatric or geriatric populations.
* Indications for Use: Know which infections or conditions specific antibiotics are used to treat.

***

#### Penicillins:

* Caution: Patients with allergies to penicillins, cephalosporins, or carbapenems.
* Use: Treats infections caused by sensitive bacteria; confirm with culture and sensitivity tests.
* Allergy Testing: Skin tests can assess allergy risk; must be done where emergency support is available.
* Renal Adjustment: Doses need adjustment for impaired renal function.
* Examples of Penicillins:
  * Narrow Spectrum Penicillins: Penicillin G, Penicillin V.
  * Penicillin-Resistant: Nafcillin, Oxacillin, Dicloxacillin.
  * Broad-Spectrum: Ampicillin, Amoxicillin, Piperacillin.
* Life Span Considerations: Safe for infants, children, and during pregnancy with caution.
* Side Effects: Allergic reactions, pain at injection sites, neurotoxicity at high levels.

***

### WEEK 2: Antifungals and Antivirals

#### Key Areas to Focus On:

* Treatment for Different Types of Infections:
  * Tinea: Topical or systemic antifungals based on severity.
  * Oral Candidiasis: Commonly treated with nystatin or oral fluconazole.
  * Aspergillosis: Typically treated with voriconazole; avoid CYP450 inducers like phenobarbital.
* Drug Interactions:
  * CYP450 Inducers: Increase metabolism of drugs, reducing effectiveness (e.g., Phenobarbital with voriconazole).
  * CYP450 Inhibitors: Decrease metabolism, increasing risk of toxicity.
* Adverse Reactions/Patient Teaching:
  * Itraconazole: Monitor for liver toxicity, gastrointestinal side effects.
  * Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs): Know example drugs like Zidovudine and Didanosine.
* Diagnostics & Monitoring for Anthelmintics: Monitor for liver function, CBC.
* High-Risk Patients: Identify those at higher risk for adverse effects with specific drugs.
* Therapeutic Effects of HIV Therapy: Measure viral load and CD4 count to assess effectiveness.

***

### WEEK 3: Treatment of Common Conditions

#### Key Areas to Focus On:

* Glaucoma Treatment:
  * Beta Blockers: Know pros and cons, especially in patients with asthma or COPD.
  * Treatment for Patients with Asthma/COPD: Prefer alternatives to beta blockers.
* Otitis Media & Externa: Understand treatment protocols for bacterial vs. fungal infections.
* Acne Treatment:
  * Mild: Topical agents like benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid.
  * Moderate: Combination therapy (topicals plus oral antibiotics).
  * Severe: Consider isotretinoin or combination therapy.
* Eczema Treatment: Recognize complications and appropriate corticosteroid use.
* Sunscreen Ingredients: Organic sunscreens should include zinc oxide or titanium dioxide.
* Mechanism of Action:
  * Expectorants: Help clear mucus from airways.
* Adverse Effects & Patient Teaching:
  * Montelukast, Intranasal Glucocorticoids, Sympathomimetics: Understand their uses, side effects, and patient education points.
* Management of Rebound Congestion: Gradual withdrawal of decongestants.
* Biologics in Allergy Treatment: Recognize their role and when they are indicated.

***

### WEEK 4: Treatment of Obesity

#### Key Areas to Focus On:

* Evaluation of Phentermine/Topiramate: Understand its role in obesity management.
* Adverse Effects/Patient Teaching:
  * Orlistat: Monitor for gastrointestinal side effects.
  * Lorcaserin: Watch for serotonin syndrome.
  * Naltrexone/Bupropion: Monitor for mood changes, potential for seizures.
* Drug Interactions:
  * Orlistat: Can affect absorption of fat-soluble vitamins.
  * Lorcaserin: Interacts with other serotonergic drugs.
* Role of Topiramate: Used in combination for weight loss; monitor for cognitive effects.
* Obesity Stages:
  * BMI: Understand the BMI range for each stage and corresponding treatment recommendations.
* DEA Schedules: Familiarize with schedules for drugs used to treat obesity (e.g., Phentermine is Schedule IV).

***

### Prescription Writing

* Medications to Know:
  * Amoxicillin: Antibiotic.
  * Tetracycline: Broad-spectrum antibiotic.
  * Benzoyl Peroxide: Topical acne treatment.
  * Acyclovir: Antiviral for herpes.
  * Timolol and Betaxolol: Beta-blockers for glaucoma.
