* Additional Tests: Consider MRI or CT scan of the head, sinus X-ray, vestibular function tests.

Next Steps:

* Conduct a thorough physical examination based on the identified symptoms.
* Order appropriate diagnostic tests to confirm the underlying condition.
* Develop a treatment plan focusing on symptom relief and addressing the root cause.

Management Plan:
