### CDC Milestone Tracker

Name
CDC Milestone Tracker

Author
The CDC Milestone Tracker was developed through a collaboration between Dr. Rosa Arriaga, students from the Atlanta Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) under the "Learn the Signs. Act Early" program (Arriaga, n.d.).

Endorsement
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention contributed to and endorsed this application to track a child's developmental milestones from two months through five years of age (Arriaga, n.d.).

Operation
The CDC Milestone Tracker is designed for use on mobile devices, making it easily accessible for parents. Given the often hectic schedules of parents with young children, the mobile platform enhances the app's usability, allowing parents to track and capture significant milestones in real-time when it is most convenient.

Aesthetics
The application is well-designed and user-friendly. It features a pleasant color scheme and a straightforward layout that avoids overwhelming users with excessive graphics or text. The large sidebar icons and bold title fonts make the app easy to read and navigate. Additionally, the lower icon bar allows for quick access to different sections of the app, such as the tracker, children, appointments, and settings. This simple navigation process is intuitive, enabling parents to easily track their child's growth and development without the need for complex instructions (Arriaga, n.d.).

Purpose
The primary purpose of the CDC Milestone Tracker is to provide parents with a simple and user-friendly tool to capture and aggregate their child's critical growth and developmental milestones from two months to five years of age (Arriaga, n.d.). The application offers multiple functions, including providing parents with valuable information, instructions, and tips on how their child should be progressing developmentally. It also includes tools to help parents achieve developmental goals. Additionally, the app integrates a communication tool that allows parents to share their child's progress with healthcare providers, facilitating better coordination of care.

This combination of features makes the CDC Milestone Tracker a valuable resource for parents looking to monitor and support their child's development during the early years.
