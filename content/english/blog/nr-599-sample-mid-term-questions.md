Here are the questions and their potential answers based on nursing informatics:

1. The nurse understands that nursing informatics as a specialty area of practice by which statement?
   * Nursing informatics integrates nursing science, computer science, and information science to manage and communicate data, information, knowledge, and wisdom in nursing practice.
2. Which statement by the nurse verifies that the nurse is “information literate”?
   * The nurse states, "I can efficiently locate, evaluate, and use information needed for clinical decision-making and patient care."
3. What is information?
   * Information is data that has been processed or organized in a way that provides meaning and is useful for making decisions.
4. The nurse gathers much data when caring for clients. Which is an example of the higher-level “information” useful in caring for clients?
   * An example of higher-level information is understanding that a patient’s elevated blood pressure, combined with their medical history and current symptoms, suggests the need for immediate intervention.
5. Which statement best distinguishes the difference between information literacy and computer literacy?
   * Information literacy involves the ability to identify, locate, evaluate, and use information effectively, whereas computer literacy refers to the ability to use computers and related technology efficiently.
6. Which statement indicates the appropriate level of informatics competencies to the correct nurse?
   * "As an advanced practice nurse, I should be proficient in using clinical decision support systems and understanding data analytics to improve patient outcomes."
7. What is Quality Information?
   * Quality information is accurate, timely, relevant, complete, and consistent data that is used to make informed decisions in clinical practice.
8. What is data?
   * Data are raw, unprocessed facts and figures without context or meaning, such as numbers or text collected during patient care.
9. What is data integrity?
   * Data integrity refers to the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data throughout its lifecycle, ensuring that it is complete and unaltered during storage, transfer, and use.
10. What is necessary to determine if a website has quality information?
    * To determine if a website has quality information, it is necessary to evaluate the credibility of the source, check for up-to-date content, assess the accuracy and relevance of the information, and ensure the site has a clear purpose and authority.
11. Why do we study nursing informatics?
    * We study nursing informatics to improve patient care outcomes by leveraging technology to enhance the management of health information, support clinical decision-making, and streamline healthcare processes.
12. What is a common reality that occurs with nursing and technology?
    * A common reality is that technology can both enhance and complicate nursing practice; while it improves access to information and patient care processes, it also requires ongoing adaptation and learning from nurses.
13. What are the functions of computers in nursing practice?
    * Computers in nursing practice are used for documentation, electronic health records (EHRs) management, patient monitoring, telehealth services, data analysis, and accessing evidence-based practice resources.
14. What is telehealth?
    * Telehealth refers to the use of digital communication technologies to deliver healthcare services and information remotely, improving access to care for patients in various locations.
15. What is biometric technology?
    * Biometric technology refers to the use of unique biological characteristics, such as fingerprints, facial recognition, or retinal scans, to identify individuals and authenticate access to systems and data.
16. How do human resources use computers?
    * Human resources use computers for employee record management, payroll processing, recruitment, training programs, benefits administration, and performance evaluation.
17. What is the definition of information technology?
    * Information technology (IT) is the use of computers, networks, storage, and other physical devices to create, process, store, secure, and exchange electronic data and information.
