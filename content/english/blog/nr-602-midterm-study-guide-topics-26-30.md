NR 602 Midterm Study Guide Topics 26-30:

### Cryptosporidium

* Overview: Cryptosporidium is a parasite that causes cryptosporidiosis, a type of gastroenteritis leading to diarrhea and vomiting. While the infection typically resolves within a week or two in healthy individuals, it can be life-threatening for immunocompromised patients.
* Symptoms:
  * Watery diarrhea
  * Dehydration
  * Lack of appetite
  * Weight loss
  * Stomach cramps
  * Fever
  * Nausea/Vomiting
  * Some individuals may be asymptomatic
* Prevention: Good hand hygiene, washing fruits and vegetables, avoiding fecal exposure, and avoiding contaminated water.

### Pyloric Stenosis

* Overview: Pyloric stenosis is caused by hypertrophy of the pyloric muscle, resulting in narrowing of the pyloric sphincter. It commonly occurs in 3/1000 births, more often in males and first-born Caucasian males, and may be linked to erythromycin administration in the first weeks of life.
* Symptoms:
  * Regurgitation and non-projectile vomiting in the first few weeks of life
  * Projectile vomiting by 2 to 3 weeks of age
  * Insatiable appetite with weight loss
  * Dehydration and constipation
* Physical Exam:
  * Weight loss
  * Vomiting, potentially containing blood
  * A palpable "olive" mass in the epigastrium to the right of the midline
  * Reverse peristalsis
* Diagnostics:
  * Ultrasound (US)
  * Upper GI series showing a "string sign"
* Management: Surgery (Pyloromyotomy) following correction of fluid balance. Prognosis is excellent.

### Intussusception

* Overview: Intussusception is a frequent cause of intestinal obstruction in children, particularly those between 5 to 10 months of age. It can also be associated with underlying medical conditions in older children, including polyps, Meckel diverticulum, and others.
* Symptoms:
  * Intermittent colicky abdominal pain
  * Vomiting
  * Bloody mucous stools ("currant jelly" stools)
  * Episodes of screaming and drawing legs up, with periods of calm or lethargy
  * History of upper respiratory infection (URI) is common
* Physical Exam:
  * Glassy-eyed appearance between episodes
  * Sausage-like mass in the right upper quadrant (RUQ) with emptiness in the right lower quadrant (RLQ) (DANCE SIGN)
  * Distended and tender abdomen
  * Positive guaiac stools
* Diagnostics: To be further detailed based on the presentation.
