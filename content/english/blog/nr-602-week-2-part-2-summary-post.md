Assessment Considerations:

* The patient’s symptoms of shortness of breath (SOB) that occur primarily at work and not at home or on weekends may suggest an environmental or occupational trigger. The previous resolution with a breathing treatment suggests the possibility of asthma or reactive airway disease. Given the lack of sputum, heartburn, and new allergy triggers, an infectious cause seems less likely, and the request for an antibiotic may need to be reconsidered. Environmental factors at her workplace should be further explored, and pulmonary function testing may be indicated to assess for asthma or other respiratory conditions.
