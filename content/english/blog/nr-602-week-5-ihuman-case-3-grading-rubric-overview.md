### NR 602 Week 5 iHuman Case 3: Grading Rubric Overview

This rubric provides a detailed guide to evaluate your performance in the iHuman case study. Each section is crucial for successfully diagnosing and managing the patient's condition. Below is a breakdown of how to approach each section:

#### 1. History Questions (40%)

* Objective: Gather a comprehensive history using structured and patient-centered questions.
* Steps:
  * Start with open-ended questions like, "How can I help you today?" and "Do you have any other symptoms or concerns?"
  * Use the "OLDCARTS" mnemonic for a thorough History of Present Illness (HPI):
    * O: Onset – When did the symptoms start?
    * L: Location – Where is the discomfort? Does it radiate?
    * D: Duration – How long have the symptoms lasted?
    * C: Characteristics – Describe the symptoms (e.g., sharp, dull, cramping).
    * A: Aggravating factors – What worsens the symptoms?
    * R: Relieving factors – What alleviates the symptoms?
    * T: Treatments – What treatments have been tried, and were they effective?
    * S: Severity – How severe are the symptoms on a scale of 1 to 10?
  * PMH: Update or gather Past Medical History, allergies, medications, and any Over-the-Counter (OTC) drugs the patient is using.
  * FH: Obtain or update Family History.
  * SH: Social History should include lifestyle, occupation, and any major recent changes (e.g., loss of a job, death of a partner).
  * ROS: Perform a Review of Systems, focusing on areas not covered in the HPI.

#### 2. Physical Exam (30%)

* Objective: Conduct a thorough physical examination based on the history provided.
* Steps:
  * Perform relevant physical assessment maneuvers.
  * Use a system-based approach to ensure that no significant finding is missed.
  * Document all findings accurately, especially those that correlate with the patient's symptoms.

#### 3. Differential Diagnosis List (10%)

* Objective: Formulate a list of possible diagnoses based on the patient's history and physical exam.
* Steps:
  * Consider all potential diagnoses before ordering tests.
  * Use evidence and clinical reasoning to narrow down the list.
  * Rank the differentials by likelihood based on the clinical presentation.

#### 4. Ranking the Differential Diagnosis (10%)

* Objective: Prioritize the differential diagnoses from most to least likely.
* Steps:
  * Rank the differential diagnoses by considering the most significant active problem (MSAP).
  * Justify the ranking based on key findings from the history and physical exam.

#### 5. Lab Tests (10%)

* Objective: Order appropriate tests to confirm or rule out the differential diagnoses.
* Steps:
  * Choose tests that will help refine your differential list.
  * Consider tests that are most likely to yield diagnostic information.
  * Review and interpret test results to guide the final diagnosis.

#### 6. Science Exercises (0%)

* Objective: Engage in interactive exercises throughout the case to enhance understanding.
* Steps:
  * Complete all "Gear Head" exercises.
  * Utilize these exercises to reinforce clinical reasoning skills and apply theoretical knowledge.

#### 7. Management Plan (0%)

* Objective: Develop a management plan tailored to the final diagnosis.
* Steps:
  * Write a comprehensive treatment plan that includes medication, patient education, follow-up, and referrals if necessary.
  * Consider both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions.
  * Address any psychosocial factors that may impact the patient's treatment and recovery.

### Steps to Complete the Case

1. History Taking:
   * Begin with open-ended questions, followed by specific HPI questions using OLDCARTS.
   * Collect a detailed PMH, FH, SH, and complete ROS.
2. Physical Exam:
   * Focus on respiratory and cardiovascular systems due to the chief complaints (cough and SOB).
   * Document all findings and correlate with the history.
3. Differential Diagnosis:
   * Consider common conditions like asthma, bronchitis, or anxiety-related hyperventilation.
   * Rank them based on the history and physical exam findings.
4. Lab Tests:
   * Consider ordering a chest X-ray, complete blood count (CBC), and possibly spirometry if asthma is suspected.
   * Interpret the results to refine your differential diagnosis.
5. Final Diagnosis and Management Plan:
   * Based on the test results and clinical reasoning, choose the most likely diagnosis.
   * Develop a management plan that includes patient education, lifestyle modifications, and follow-up.
6. Science Exercises:
   * Engage in the exercises provided during the case to reinforce your understanding.
7. Summary:
   * Review the entire case and submit it. Check the "see evaluation" button to review your performance.
