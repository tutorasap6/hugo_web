Question 6
A pleasant 73-year-old male presents to the clinic with his wife. His wife states that she has noted increasing problems with his memory, including forgetting to get some items on his grocery list and misplacing his car keys. You administer the MMSE in the office, and he scores 24/30, which is consistent with Mild Dementia per the scoring guidelines. Your best response to his wife is:

* The MMSE score alone is a strong indicator of Dementia, and we can proceed with medication based on these results.
* The MMSE score along with the memory issues are more concerning for head injury, so we will pursue a head CT to rule out TBI.
* The MMSE score alone is concerning for Dementia, but the memory issues can be a part of normal brain function, so we need to rule out organic causes before concluding a diagnosis of Dementia (correct answer)
* The MMSE score along with the memory issues you identified are very strong indicators of Dementia, so we will begin first-line treatment with Donepezil (Aricept) today.
