NR 661 General class information (boards, NPI, DEA, credentialing, interviews, contracts info at the bottom):

THIS IS A CRAZY LONG Intro. Save yourself the time and just find the “intro post” in the 661 shared drive and print it out. You’ll need to look back at the info many times over the next 3 plus months and won’t want to keep coming back to Facebook to find it. Plus, the one in the drive is in pretty colors and has the sections spaced better. Use Control+F to search for whatever in these 16 pages here and in the doc in the shared drive.

\*\*\*\*\* In case you haven’t saved info from the shared drives, I will delete them in the months following graduation to eliminate my burgeoning data. Use the links below to save what you want to keep \*\*\*\*

Very little of the following is my original info. Everything in this is compiled from the FB pages of classes ahead of us. I THINK it is current and correct, but please check Canvas for accuracy. A fair amount of the boards and credentialing information came from Erin Oberly. If you notify me of any inaccuracies, I will post them to the group.

Clinical hours for 661:

We get 20 clinical hours from Intensive review and can also log 15 alternative hours. This leaves 105 hours needed for a total of 125 hours for 8 weeks.

Overall class assignments/ info:

NR 661 has 3 papers (wk 1, 5, 6) case studies (weeks 2, 4, 6), 2 part portfolio (due week 5 and 6), APEA videos to watch, and there are 3 timed APEA exams (50 questions each), 3 practice quizzes, APEA practice exams (30 points each in weeks 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), APEA Intensive review (October 13-15, 200 points), and the final APEA exit exam week 8 (300 points). Vise- see week 3 below.

See the shared drive for the assignments in a table form by week/ due days, VISE study information, boards study info, and more. I add stuff throughout the class, especially in the first few weeks. The quizzes are based on some case studies that are NOT graded but have 40 questions each.

Regarding the exit exam (AKA APEA post predictor exam) one student said: "It wasn't as hard as I heard... make a nice cushion for yourself and complete every single APEA practice question and read the rationales. If you do that you will increase your chances of scoring in the high 90 percent or even a 100 on some and that will give you close to the full 30 points each week on the quizzes.”

Note that our intensive review weekend comes at the END of week 6. Part 2 of the Portfolio is due then too!

The NR 661 course has a wealth of critical information that you will refer to frequently over the next few months. To make your life easier, I strongly recommend printing out the “intro post” available in the 661 shared drive. This document is neatly formatted with spaced-out sections and is much easier to navigate than scrolling through Facebook posts. By using the Control+F function, you can quickly search through the 16 pages both here and in the shared drive document.

Please note that the information stored in the shared drives will be deleted in the months following graduation, so be sure to save anything you might need. The relevant links to the shared drives are provided below:

Most of the information included here is compiled from the Facebook pages of previous classes, so while it should be current, always check Canvas to ensure accuracy. If you find any inaccuracies, please let me know so I can update the group accordingly.

### Clinical Hours for NR 661:

You will need to complete a total of 125 clinical hours over 8 weeks. This breaks down into 20 clinical hours from the Intensive review, 15 alternative hours, leaving you with 105 additional hours to complete.

### Overall Class Assignments/Info:

NR 661 is a busy course with several assignments and exams:

* 3 Papers: Due in weeks 1, 5, and 6
* Case Studies: In weeks 2, 4, and 6
* 2-Part Portfolio: Due in weeks 5 and 6
* APEA Videos: To be watched throughout the course
* APEA Exams: 3 timed exams (50 questions each)
* Practice Quizzes: 3 in total
* APEA Practice Exams: Worth 30 points each, due in weeks 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7
* APEA Intensive Review: Scheduled for October 13-15, worth 200 points
* Final APEA Exit Exam: Scheduled for week 8, worth 300 points

The quizzes are based on case studies that are not graded but consist of 40 questions each. One key piece of advice regarding the exit exam (APEA post-predictor exam) is to complete every APEA practice question and read the rationales thoroughly. Doing so may significantly boost your chances of scoring in the high 90s or even achieving a perfect score, which can earn you close to the full 30 points each week on the quizzes.

Note that the Intensive Review weekend occurs at the end of week 6, coinciding with the due date for Part 2 of the Portfolio.

Lastly, check the shared drive for assignments laid out in a table by week and due dates, VISE study information, boards study information, and more. I will continue to add resources throughout the course, especially during the first few weeks.
