NR NR224 Unit 8 Clinical Preparation Worksheet 

1. What is an H\&P?
   * H\&P stands for History and Physical. It is a comprehensive medical evaluation that includes the patient’s medical history and the findings from a physical examination.
2. What might have triggered this patient’s GI bleed?
   * The GI bleed could have been triggered by factors such as peptic ulcers, gastritis, use of NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), or other gastrointestinal conditions that cause bleeding in the digestive tract.
3. What does H\&H stand for? Why was this lab test prescribed for this patient?
   * H\&H stands for Hemoglobin and Hematocrit. This lab test was likely prescribed to assess the patient’s blood levels, as low hemoglobin and hematocrit values could indicate significant blood loss due to the GI bleed.
4. What is melena? What does melena indicate?
   * Melena is the passage of black, tarry stools, which indicates that there is bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract, such as the stomach or small intestine.
5. Why might this patient have experienced melena during the past week?
   * The patient may have experienced melena due to ongoing or recent bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract, possibly from a peptic ulcer or other bleeding source.
6. Why might this patient’s vital signs be abnormal?
   * The patient’s vital signs may be abnormal due to blood loss from the GI bleed, which can lead to low blood pressure, an increased heart rate, and other signs of hemodynamic instability.
7. Why might this patient’s stomach be firm and distended?
   * The patient’s stomach may be firm and distended due to the accumulation of blood or fluid in the abdominal cavity, or due to bowel distension caused by the GI bleed.
