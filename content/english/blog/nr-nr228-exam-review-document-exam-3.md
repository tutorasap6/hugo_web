### ATI #1 - Nurse Touch - Wellness & Self-Care - Eating Healthy & Maintaining a Healthy Weight Module - Posttest

1\. As part of a weight-loss workshop in the local community, a nurse is teaching participants how to use anthropometric measurements for self-assessment. Which of the following measurements from participants indicates a healthy waist-to-hip ratio?

* a. Male, 36 inches waist, 34 inches hips
* b. Female, waist 28 inches, hips 31 inches
* c. Male, waist 38 inches, hips 41 inches
  Rationale: To calculate the waist-to-hip ratio, divide the circumference of the waist by the circumference of the hips. For a healthy waist-to-hip ratio, a man's ratio should be below 0.95, and a woman's ratio should be below 0.8.
  * For choice a: 3634≈1.06\frac{36}{34} \approx 1.063436​≈1.06, which is not a healthy ratio.
  * For choice b: 2831≈0.90\frac{28}{31} \approx 0.903128​≈0.90, which is not a healthy ratio for a woman (should be below 0.8).
  * For choice c: 3841≈0.93\frac{38}{41} \approx 0.934138​≈0.93, which is a healthy ratio for a man (below 0.95).

Thus, c. Male, waist 38 inches, hips 41 inches is the correct answer.

2\. Which of the following guidelines does the National Weight Control Registry endorse as a strategy that worked for people it studied who successfully lost weight and maintained it over time?

* a. Engaging in regular physical activity.
* b. Consuming a low-calorie, low-fat diet.
* c. Monitoring weight regularly.
* Rationale: The National Weight Control Registry has identified that people who successfully lose weight and maintain that weight over time often adhere to certain behaviors. These include engaging in regular physical activity, consuming a low-calorie and low-fat diet, monitoring their weight regularly, and eating breakfast daily. These strategies collectively contribute to successful long-term weight management.

3\. A nurse is giving a presentation at a community center about the health risks of obesity. Which of the following disorders should the nurse include? (Select all that apply).

* a. Type 2 diabetes
* b. Hypertension
* c. Cardiovascular disease
* d. Osteoarthritis
* Rationale: Obesity is associated with several health risks and disorders. These include:
  * Type 2 diabetes: Excess body weight increases insulin resistance, leading to higher blood glucose levels.
  * Hypertension: Obesity can contribute to elevated blood pressure, increasing the risk of heart disease.
  * Cardiovascular disease: Increased body fat, particularly around the abdomen, is linked to a higher risk of heart disease.
  * Osteoarthritis: Extra body weight places additional stress on joints, leading to wear and tear, particularly in weight-bearing joints.
  * Sleep apnea: Excess weight, especially around the neck, can obstruct breathing during sleep, leading to sleep apnea.

Thus, the correct answers are a, b, c, d, and e.
