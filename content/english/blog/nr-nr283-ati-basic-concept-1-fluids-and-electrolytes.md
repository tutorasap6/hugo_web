### NR 283 ATI Basic Concept #1: Fluids and Electrolytes

***

#### Introduction

* Importance: Fluids and electrolytes are vital for maintaining homeostasis within the body. They play a critical role in various physiological functions, including nerve conduction, muscle contraction, and maintaining the balance of fluids within compartments.

***

#### Key Electrolytes:

1. Sodium (Na+):
   * Normal Range: 135-145 mEq/L
   * Functions:
     * Maintains extracellular fluid (ECF) volume.
     * Influences water distribution.
     * Necessary for nerve and muscle function.
   * Imbalances:
     * Hyponatremia: Can lead to confusion, seizures, and muscle weakness.
     * Hypernatremia: Can cause dehydration, thirst, and neurological symptoms.
2. Potassium (K+):
   * Normal Range: 3.5-5.0 mEq/L
   * Functions:
     * Essential for nerve impulse transmission.
     * Critical for muscle contraction, particularly in the heart.
   * Imbalances:
     * Hypokalemia: Can cause muscle weakness, arrhythmias, and cramps.
     * Hyperkalemia: Can result in cardiac arrhythmias and muscle paralysis.
3. Calcium (Ca2+):
   * Normal Range: 8.5-10.5 mg/dL
   * Functions:
     * Important for bone health and structure.
     * Plays a role in blood clotting and nerve transmission.
   * Imbalances:
     * Hypocalcemia: Can cause tetany, muscle spasms, and cardiac issues.
     * Hypercalcemia: May lead to kidney stones, bone pain, and mental confusion.
4. Magnesium (Mg2+):
   * Normal Range: 1.5-2.5 mEq/L
   * Functions:
     * Supports muscle and nerve function.
     * Involved in enzyme reactions and energy production.
   * Imbalances:
     * Hypomagnesemia: Can lead to neuromuscular excitability and cardiac arrhythmias.
     * Hypermagnesemia: May cause muscle weakness, respiratory depression, and hypotension.
5. Chloride (Cl-):
   * Normal Range: 95-105 mEq/L
   * Functions:
     * Works with sodium to maintain osmotic pressure.
     * Involved in acid-base balance.
   * Imbalances:
     * Hypochloremia: Can result in metabolic alkalosis.
     * Hyperchloremia: Can cause metabolic acidosis.
6. Phosphate (PO4-):
   * Normal Range: 2.5-4.5 mg/dL
   * Functions:
     * Vital for energy storage and transfer (ATP).
     * Important in bone formation and cellular function.
   * Imbalances:
     * Hypophosphatemia: Can cause muscle weakness and bone pain.
     * Hyperphosphatemia: May result in calcification of soft tissues and renal failure.

#### Fluid Balance:

1. Body Fluid Compartments:
   * Intracellular Fluid (ICF): Fluid inside cells; makes up about 2/3 of body water.
   * Extracellular Fluid (ECF): Fluid outside cells, including interstitial fluid and plasma.
2. Fluid Imbalances:
   * Dehydration: Loss of more water than electrolytes; can cause dry skin, decreased urine output, and confusion.
   * Overhydration: Excess water relative to electrolytes; can lead to edema, hypertension, and altered mental status.
3. Fluid Movement:
   * Osmosis: Movement of water from low to high solute concentration.
   * Diffusion: Movement of solutes from high to low concentration.
   * Filtration: Movement of fluid through a membrane driven by pressure.
   * Active Transport: Movement of electrolytes against a gradient, requiring energy.

#### Nursing Considerations:

* Assessment:
  * Monitor vital signs, particularly blood pressure and heart rate, for signs of fluid imbalance.
  * Assess lab values for electrolyte levels.
  * Observe for symptoms of electrolyte imbalances (e.g., muscle cramps, confusion, cardiac irregularities).
* Interventions:
  * Fluid Replacement: Administer IV fluids as ordered to correct imbalances.
  * Electrolyte Management: Supplement or restrict electrolytes as needed.
  * Education: Teach patients about the importance of balanced fluid and electrolyte intake, especially in conditions like heart failure, kidney disease, and after surgery.
* Monitoring:
  * Regularly check fluid input and output to assess balance.
  * Monitor for signs of fluid overload or dehydration.
  * Ensure proper electrolyte balance is maintained, adjusting treatment as necessary.
