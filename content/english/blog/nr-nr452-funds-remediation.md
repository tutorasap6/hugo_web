### 1. Firearms Safety Education for a Toddler's Home

Question: A nurse is providing home safety education to the mother of a toddler. The mother is a law enforcement officer and is required to carry a handgun. What recommendation should the nurse make regarding firearms in the home?

Answer: The nurse should recommend that all firearms, including the handgun, be securely stored in a locked container that is inaccessible to the toddler. The ammunition should be stored separately from the firearm, also in a locked location. Additionally, the nurse should advise that the keys or codes to the locks should be kept out of reach and knowledge of the child. It is also important to educate the mother about the dangers of firearms and the importance of constant supervision to ensure the safety of the child.

### 2. Ensuring Client Confidentiality During Documentation

Question: A nurse is documenting on the electronic medical record (EMR). How should the nurse ensure client confidentiality during documentation?

Answer: To ensure client confidentiality during documentation, the nurse should:

* Always log out of the computer or close the EMR when leaving the workstation, even if just for a short period.
* Use privacy screens on monitors to prevent unauthorized viewing of sensitive information, especially in shared or public areas.
* Never share their password or login credentials with anyone else.
* Ensure that only authorized personnel have access to the client's EMR.
* Avoid discussing client information in public areas or with individuals who do not have a need-to-know basis.

### 3. Principles of Wound Care for a Client with Sutures

Question: What principles of wound care should the nurse include when completing wound care for a client with sutures?

Answer: When completing wound care for a client with sutures, the nurse should follow these three principles:

1. Assessment: The nurse should assess the wound for signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, warmth, and discharge. The condition of the sutures and surrounding skin should also be evaluated.
2. Cleansing: The nurse should gently cleanse the wound with an appropriate antiseptic solution or as ordered by the healthcare provider. The area should be kept clean to prevent infection. Care should be taken not to disturb the sutures during cleaning.
3. Protection: The nurse should apply a sterile dressing over the sutures to protect the wound from contamination and further injury. The dressing should be changed as per protocol or whenever it becomes wet or soiled. The nurse should also educate the client on how to care for the wound at home and the importance of keeping the area dry and clean.
