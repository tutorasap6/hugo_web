### NR452 Medication Calculation Practice: Preparation for Math Exam

NR452 Practice Medication Calculation - Student Copy 2022

Student Full Name: \[Your Name]
Date: \[Insert Date]
Time: \[Insert Time]

During the NR452 course, you are required to demonstrate proficiency in medication calculations by passing the math exam with a 100% score on the first day of class. To prepare for the math exam, please thoroughly review the NR452 medication calculation policy and complete the attached NR452 medication calculation packet. This packet serves as supplemental practice in addition to the practice quiz available on Canvas.

Important Instructions:

* Complete both the practice quiz on Canvas and this math packet before attempting the math exam.
* If you experience difficulty completing the math practice packet, seek assistance from the Student Learning Center (SLC) or your designated course instructor.
* Completion of the NR452 math packet is mandatory; it serves as your "ticket" to take the math exam on the first day of class. You will not be permitted to take the math exam if your work is incomplete.

Guidelines for Calculation:

* Use the dimensional analysis method to show your work.
* Round your answers to the specified decimal place(s).
* Use a leading zero for amounts less than 1 (e.g., 0.6 mL).
* Avoid trailing zeros (e.g., 6 mg instead of 6.0 mg).
* Round drops (gtt) to the nearest whole number.

Per Chamberlain policy, you have three attempts to achieve the required 100% benchmark to pass the NR452 course. If you are unsuccessful on the first attempt, you must remediate with your didactic instructor by Thursday of Week 1. If unsuccessful on the second attempt, you must remediate with the SLS team by Tuesday of Week 2. After remediation, you must wait 24 hours before retaking the math exam. Schedule your retake with your didactic instructor once you have met all remediation requirements.

Please submit this medication calculation packet on Canvas by Sunday, March 5th, by 11:59 PM to qualify for the first medication calculation exam on the first day of class. Failure to submit by this deadline will result in a voided math exam and a zero in the gradebook. Additionally, students must complete the Math Calc Practice Exam with a score of 100% to proceed.
