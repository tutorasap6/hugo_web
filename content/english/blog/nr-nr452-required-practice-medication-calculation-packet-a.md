### NR452 Required Practice Medication Calculation Packet Overview

Student Name: Corina Biscos-Vinesar
Date: 10/21/20
Time: 11:00 AM

### Key Deadlines:

* Initial Math Exam: Monday, Oct 26, 11:59 PM
* 2nd Math Attempt Remediation Deadline: Monday, Nov 02, 5:00 PM
* 2nd Math Attempt Completion Deadline: Wednesday, Nov 04, 11:59 PM
* 3rd Math Attempt Remediation Completion Deadline: Thursday, Nov 05, 5:00 PM
* Final Deadline to Pass Math Exam: Friday, Nov 06, 5:00 PM

### Steps to Complete:

1. Complete the NR452 Medication Calculation Packet:
   * The packet must be completed in preparation for the math exam on the first day of class (Oct 26).
   * All calculations should be typed using the dimensional analysis grids provided in the packet.
   * Handwritten work is not acceptable.
2. Submit Your Packet:
   * Submit the completed math medication packet in Microsoft Word format via Canvas under Unit 1 by Monday, Oct 26, 11:59 PM.
   * Failure to submit by the deadline will result in a zero for the math exam, and no retakes will be allowed.
3. Retake and Remediation (if necessary):
   * If the required 95% benchmark is not met on the first attempt, you have two additional attempts.
   * Remediation is required before retaking the exam:
     * Complete remediation for the 2nd attempt by Monday, Nov 02, 5:00 PM.
     * Meet with Dean Yau and your didactic instructor after a failed 2nd attempt.
   * After the 2nd failed attempt, prepare for the 3rd attempt by completing satisfactory remediation by Thursday, Nov 05, 5:00 PM.
   * Schedule your math retake with your didactic instructor, ensuring a 24-hour wait period after remediation before retaking the exam.

### Important Reminders:

* Rounding Rules:
  * Round answers to two decimal places unless specified.
  * Use a leading zero for amounts less than 1 (e.g., 0.6 mL).
  * Do not use trailing zeros (e.g., 6 mg instead of 6.0 mg).
  * Round drops (gtt) to the nearest whole number.
* Submission Format:
  * Save your work as a Microsoft Word document.
  * Ensure completeness and accuracy in the dimensional analysis grids.

### Consequences:

* Failure to complete the math packet and submit it by the specified deadline will result in the voiding of your math exam and a zero score.
* You will not be allowed to take the math exam or retake it if the packet is incomplete or not submitted on time.

By following these instructions carefully, you will be adequately prepared for the NR452 medication calculation exam and meet all necessary requirements.

### Example Scenario:

Medication Order: Administer 250 mg of Amoxicillin.
Available Medication: Amoxicillin 125 mg/5 mL.
Question: How many milliliters (mL) of Amoxicillin should the nurse administer?

### Step-by-Step Calculation Using Dimensional Analysis:

1. Identify what you need to find:
   * The amount of medication in mL that needs to be administered.
2. Set up the dimensional analysis grid:
   * Place the desired unit (mL) on top and the given information that will allow you to cancel out units until you are left with mL.

### Dimensional Analysis Setup:

Desired Dose (mg)×Volume of Available Solution (mL)Amount of Drug in Available Solution (mg)=Dose to Administer (mL)\text{Desired Dose (mg)} \times \frac{\text{Volume of Available Solution (mL)}}{\text{Amount of Drug in Available Solution (mg)}} = \text{Dose to Administer (mL)}Desired Dose (mg)×Amount of Drug in Available Solution (mg)Volume of Available Solution (mL)​=Dose to Administer (mL)250 mg×5 mL125 mg=? mL250 \\, \text{mg} \times \frac{5 \\, \text{mL}}{125 \\, \text{mg}} = \text{? mL}250mg×125mg5mL​=? mL

1. Perform the calculation:

250 mg×5 mL125 mg=10 mL\frac{250 \\, \text{mg} \times 5 \\, \text{mL}}{125 \\, \text{mg}} = 10 \\, \text{mL}125mg250mg×5mL​=10mL

1. Result:
   * The nurse should administer 10 mL of Amoxicillin.

### Important Notes:

* Rounding: In this case, the answer is a whole number, so no rounding is necessary.
* Dimensional Analysis Grid: This calculation method ensures all units cancel out correctly, leaving you with the desired unit (mL in this case).

* Answer: The nurse should administer 10 mL of Amoxicillin.

This example shows how to use dimensional analysis to solve a medication calculation problem, ensuring accuracy and compliance with nursing protocols.
