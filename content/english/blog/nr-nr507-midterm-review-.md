NR 507: MIDTERM REVIEW

### Hematology

Hematopoiesis:

* Hematopoiesis is the process of blood cell production, which is constant throughout life to replace RBCs that age, die, are destroyed by disease, or are lost due to bleeding.
* In the fetus, hematopoiesis occurs in the liver and spleen. After birth, it takes place in the bone marrow.
* Hematopoiesis occurs in two stages:
  1. Proliferation (Mitotic Division): The process where hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) multiply.
  2. Maturation (Differentiation): The process where HSCs differentiate into various blood cells.

Bone Marrow:

* Red Marrow: Hematopoietic and active in blood cell production.
* Yellow Marrow: Fatty and inactive.

Hematopoietic Lineages:

* Lymphoid Lineage: T cells (T-lymphocytes) and B cells (B-lymphocytes).
* Myeloid Lineage: Monocytes and Granulocytes (WBCs).
* Erythrocytes (RBCs).

Megakaryocytes (Platelets).

* All blood cells originate from HSCs.
* These cells are signaled to differentiate into specific blood cells by cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, forming RBCs, WBCs, and platelets.

Mesenchymal Stem Cells:

* Develop into osteoclasts, fibroblasts, and adipocytes.

Erythropoietin:

* Erythropoietin is a hormone that stimulates erythrocyte production.
* It is secreted by the kidneys in response to tissue hypoxia.

Erythrocytes (Red Blood Cells):

* Erythrocytes are the most abundant cells in the body, primarily responsible for tissue oxygenation.
* Mature erythrocytes lack a nucleus and mitochondria, meaning they cannot synthesize protein, carry out oxidative reactions, or divide. They rely solely on anaerobic metabolism.
* Life Span: 100-120 days.

Stages of Erythropoiesis (7-day process):

* Hemocytoblast (Stem Cell): Binds with erythropoietin.
* Proerythroblast: Commits to becoming an RBC.
* Erythroblast: Undergoes ribosome synthesis (2 phases).
* Normoblast: Accumulates hemoglobin and ejects the nucleus.
* Reticulocyte: An immature RBC released into circulation, lacking a nucleus, ribosomes, and mitochondria.
* RBC: After maturing in the bone marrow for 1-2 days, it becomes a fully functional RBC.

Hemoglobin:

* Hemoglobin is the oxygen-carrying protein in erythrocytes.
* Hemoglobin-packed RBCs pick up oxygen in the lungs and exchange it for carbon dioxide in the tissues.
* Composition: Hemoglobin is composed of 2 pairs of polypeptide chains (globins) and 4 iron-containing complexes (hemes).
* Each hemoglobin molecule can carry up to 4 oxygen molecules.
  * Oxyhemoglobin: Hemoglobin bound to oxygen, appears red.
  * Deoxyhemoglobin: Hemoglobin after releasing oxygen to the tissues, appears blue.

Risk Factors and Causes for Developing Anemia:

* Blood loss (acute or chronic).
* Impaired erythrocyte production.
* Increased erythrocyte destruction.
* A combination of these factors.

Iron Deficiency Anemia - Microcytic-Hypochromic Anemia:

* The most common nutritional disorder.
* Occurs when iron stores are depleted, leading to reduced hemoglobin synthesis.
* Common in: Toddlers, adolescent girls, and women of childbearing age.
* Causes:
  * Dietary deficiency.
  * Impaired absorption.
  * Increased requirement.
  * Chronic blood loss.

Thalassemia - Microcytic-Hypochromic Anemia:

* An inherited autosomal recessive disorder.
* Characterized by impaired synthesis of one of the two chains of adult hemoglobin (alpha or beta).
* Common Among: Individuals of Mediterranean descent.
* Thalassemia can range from minor (asymptomatic) to major (potentially lethal, such as Cooleyâ€™s).

Sickle Cell Anemia - Normocytic-Normochromic/Hemolytic Anemia:

* An inherited autosomal recessive disorder.
* Characterized by the presence of atypical hemoglobin (Hemoglobin S).
* Cause: An amino acid change on the beta-globin chain (glutamine is replaced by valine), which distorts erythrocytes into a sickle shape, impairing their ability to carry oxygen.
