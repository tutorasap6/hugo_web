* Answer: Functional residual capacity.

Question 18: Upon examination of the male infant, it is observed that the urethral meatus is located on the undersurface of the penis. The nurse will document this condition as:

* Answer: Hypospadias.

Question 19: If the FNP wants to obtain the best estimate of renal function, which test should the nurse monitor?

* Answer: Glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

Question 20: A 54-year-old male with a long history of smoking complains of excessive tiredness, shortness of breath, and overall ill feelings. Lab results reveal decreased pH, increased CO2, and normal bicarbonate ion. These findings help to confirm the diagnosis of:

* Answer: Respiratory acidosis.

Question 21: A 5-year-old male presents with low-set ears, a fish-shaped mouth, and involuntary rapid muscular contraction. Laboratory testing reveals decreased calcium levels. Which of the following diagnoses is most likely?

* Answer: DiGeorge syndrome.

Question 22: When the FNP is checking the urinalysis, plasma proteins should be absent from the urine because:

* Answer: The glomerular filtration barrier normally prevents plasma proteins from entering the urine.

Question 23: A 55-year-old female reports urinary retention. Tests reveal a lower urinary tract obstruction. Which of the following is of most concern to the nurse?

* Answer: Potential development of hydronephrosis and kidney damage.

Question 24: The lamina propria area of the bronchioles plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of chronic bronchitis because this is where:

* Answer: Inflammatory cells and mediators accumulate, leading to bronchial wall thickening and mucus hypersecretion.

Question 25: Pulmonary function tests reveal that an 80-year-old dyspneic patient has an increase in residual volume. The FNP suspects the most likely cause of the increased residual volume is \_\_\_\_ in lung compliance.

* Answer: An increase in lung compliance, typically seen in emphysema.

Question 26: The nurse practitioner would correctly respond that the etiology of a congenital immune deficiency is due to a:

* Answer: Genetic mutation affecting immune system development.

Question 27: Carbon dioxide is mainly transported in the blood as:

* Answer: Bicarbonate ion (HCO3-).

Question 28: The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is directly related to the:

* Answer: Perfusion pressure in the glomerular capillaries.

Question 29: When considering abnormal epigenetic modifications, what factor is currently being viewed as strongly associated with the development of some cancers?

* Answer: DNA methylation patterns.

Question 30: Which of the following clusters of symptoms would support a child’s diagnosis of glomerulonephritis?

* Answer: Hematuria, proteinuria, and hypertension.

* Answer: Jaundice and a positive direct Coombs test.

Question 34: During inspiration, muscular contraction of the diaphragm causes air to move into the lung. The mechanism that drives air movement during inspiration results from:

* Answer: A decrease in intrathoracic pressure, leading to airflow into the lungs.
