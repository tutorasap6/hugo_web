### NR 507 Week 4 Midterm Questions and Answers

Question 1: Hypertension (high blood pressure) will have its most immediate effect on:

* Answer: End-diastolic volume.

Question 5: Glomerulonephritis is associated with a(n):

* Answer: Inflammatory response in the glomeruli, often leading to hematuria, proteinuria, and decreased glomerular filtration rate.

* Answer: Hypernatremia.

Question 7: A prolonged episode of tachycardia will result in:

* Answer: Decreased ventricular filling time, potentially leading to reduced cardiac output and tissue perfusion.

Question 8: Tubular reabsorption and tubular secretion differ in that:

* Answer: Tubular reabsorption involves the movement of substances from the filtrate back into the blood, while tubular secretion involves the movement of substances from the blood into the filtrate.

Question 9: After erythrocytes have completed their lifespan, they are removed by macrophages mainly in the:

* Answer: Spleen.

Question 10: Alveolar hyperinflation occurs in asthma and chronic bronchitis as the result of:

* Answer: Air trapping due to obstruction of airflow and loss of elastic recoil in the alveoli.

Question 11: The primary site of damage in the nephron due to ischemic conditions is the:

* Answer: Proximal tubule.

Question 12: The movement of blood into and out of the capillary beds of the lungs to the body tissues and cells describes the process of:

* Answer: Perfusion.

Question 13: A 5-year-old female presents with frequent urinary tract infections. Imaging studies indicate a retrograde flow of urine from the urinary bladder into the ureters. This is indicative of:

* Answer: Vesicoureteral reflux.

Question 14: A 30-year-old client who had a gastrectomy procedure 1 year ago is most at risk for the development of:

* Answer: Pernicious anemia due to a deficiency of intrinsic factor leading to impaired vitamin B12 absorption.

Question 15: A deficiency of intrinsic factor (IF) will most likely result in:

* Answer: Pernicious anemia.

Question 16: During ventricular systole:

* Answer: The ventricles contract, pumping blood into the aorta and pulmonary arteries.

Question 17: A deficiency of transferrin is most likely to result in:

* Answer: Iron deficiency anemia.

Question 18: The primary source of erythropoietin is the:

* Answer: Kidneys.

Question 19: Which of the following is not a condition associated with renal failure?

* Answer: Hyperthyroidism.

Question 20: A 25-year-old female presents with frequent complete calculi blockage of one ureter. This is referred to as:

* Answer: Obstructive uropathy.

Question 21: Contractility of cardiac muscle is directly dependent on the level of:

* Answer: Calcium ions.

Question 22: Appropriate management of progressive renal failure typically includes:

* Answer: Dialysis or kidney transplantation, along with management of hypertension, electrolyte imbalances, and fluid overload.

Question 23: In addition to oxygen, hemoglobin also carries nitric oxide (NO). NO is important for:

* Answer: Vasodilation and regulation of blood flow.

Question 24: Which equation correctly represents cardiac output (CO)?

* Answer: CO = Stroke Volume (SV) × Heart Rate (HR).

Question 25: Which of the following statements correctly describes the flow of blood between the heart and lungs?

* Answer: Blood flows from the right ventricle to the lungs via the pulmonary arteries and returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins.

Question 26: Blood (hydrostatic) pressure is most important for the process of:

* Answer: Filtration in the capillaries.

Question 27: Preload can increase by all the following except:

* Answer: Increased heart rate (which actually decreases preload due to reduced filling time).

Question 28: Cardiac tamponade:

* Answer: Results in the compression of the heart due to fluid accumulation in the pericardial sac, leading to decreased cardiac output.

Question 29: The lamina propria area of the bronchioles plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of chronic bronchitis because this is where:

* Answer: Inflammatory cells and mediators accumulate, leading to bronchial wall thickening and obstruction.

Question 30: Which of the following will occur when calcium binds to troponin?

* Answer: It facilitates the interaction of actin and myosin, leading to muscle contraction.

Question 31: The average red blood cell lifespan is approximately:

* Answer: 120 days.

Question 32: The correct definition of afterload is:

* Answer: The resistance the left ventricle must overcome to eject blood into the systemic circulation.

Question 33: An accident victim transfused with the incorrect blood type is at most risk for the development of:

* Answer: Hemolytic transfusion reaction.

Question 34: A client experiencing congestive heart failure (CHF) would experience the following sequence of events:

* Answer: Decreased cardiac output → Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) → Fluid retention and increased preload → Worsening heart failure.

Question 35: The condition most associated with a history of seasonal and/or chronic allergies is:

* Answer: Allergic rhinitis.

Question 36: Preload refers specifically to:

* Answer: The volume of blood in the ventricles at the end of diastole.

Question 37: ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitors work by:

* Answer: Inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, leading to vasodilation and reduced blood pressure.

Question 38: Closure of the semilunar valves (SLV) occurs during:

* Answer: The beginning of diastole, as the ventricles relax.

Question 39: A 78-year-old patient is scheduled for an imaging procedure using contrast dye. Although rare, you know that he may be at risk for contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) because of his history of:

* Answer: Chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Question 40: The normal primary site of hematopoiesis in the adult is:

* Answer: The bone marrow.

Question 41: A 78-year-old male diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is at increased risk for the development of:

* Answer: Urinary retention and possible urinary tract infections.

Question 42: Afterload can be increased by all the following except:

* Answer: Hypotension (which would decrease afterload).

Question 43: The blood disorders sickle-cell anemia and thalassemia are:

* Answer: Genetic disorders that affect hemoglobin synthesis.

Question 44: Treatment for asthma includes anticholinergic drugs. The mechanism of action for the medication is to:

* Answer: Block the muscarinic receptors, leading to bronchodilation.

Question 45: A client who is 2 days post-partum is most at risk for the development of:

* Answer: Postpartum hemorrhage or deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Question 46: A client with chronic bronchitis is most likely to experience:

* Answer: Chronic cough, mucus production, and dyspnea on exertion.

Question 47: An aortic semilunar valve stenosis would have the most immediate effect by:

* Answer: Increasing afterload on the left ventricle, leading to left ventricular hypertrophy.

Question 48: In the healthy heart, the response to an increase in preload is for stroke volume to:

* Answer: Increase, according to the Frank-Starling law of the heart.

Question 49: Decreased contractility can be caused by all the following except:

* Answer: Increased sympathetic stimulation (which actually increases contractility).

Question 50: Cor pulmonale refers to:

* Answer: Right-sided heart failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension or chronic lung disease.
