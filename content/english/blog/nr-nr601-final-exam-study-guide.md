NR 601 Final Exam Review: Weeks 5-8 Content

***

### Week 5: Glucose Metabolism Disorders

#### Types of Diabetes (Prediabetes, Type 1, and Type 2)

* Islet Cell-Specific Antibodies: Found in 70-80% of individuals with prediabetes and newly diagnosed Type 1 Diabetes (DM1). Hyperglycemia typically develops after 80-90% of beta cells are destroyed.
* Type 1 Diabetes: An autoimmune attack on the pancreas's beta cells prevents insulin production and secretion, leading to insulin deficiency.
* Type 2 Diabetes: The pancreas continues to secrete insulin, but cells throughout the body fail to respond adequately (insulin resistance), resulting in relative insulin deficiency.
* Diagnostic Criteria: Based on ketonuria, age of onset, and BMI. Antibody testing and c-peptide levels help determine the type:
  * Type 1: Antibodies present in 70-80%, extremely low c-peptide levels.
  * Type 2: Typically occurs in individuals ≥ 40 years old with a BMI > 27 and minimal/no ketonuria.
  * Diagnosis is confirmed with either two fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels ≥ 126 mg/dL or a random blood glucose (BG) level ≥ 200 mg/dL with symptoms.
  * Symptomatic patients with one positive test are diagnosed with DM2; asymptomatic patients require two positive tests.
  * HbA1c ≥ 6.5% indicates DM2.
* Screening Recommendations: For anyone overweight with additional risk factors; begins at 45 years old and repeated every 3 years.
* Initial Treatment for Type 2:
  * Lifestyle modifications (weight loss, exercise) are first-line therapy.
  * If non-pharmacologic treatment fails after 3-6 months or if FBG is 200-300 mg/dL, add Metformin. Dual pharmacotherapy is not recommended unless HbA1c ≥ 9%.
  * Metformin (Glucophage): Decreases hepatic glucose production, intestinal glucose absorption, and increases insulin sensitivity. Initial dosing is 500 mg daily, then BID.
  * Sulfonylureas: Increase pancreatic insulin secretion, lowering HbA1c by 1.25%.
  * Meglitinides: Increase insulin release from the pancreas, reducing HbA1c by about 1%.
  * Thiazolidinediones (TZDs): Increase insulin sensitivity, reduce A1c by 1-1.5%, but contraindicated in patients with HF, bladder cancer, osteoporosis, or liver disease.
  * Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP-4) Inhibitors: Increase bioavailability of GLP1, used once daily.
  * Alpha-Glucosidase Inhibitors: Delay glucose absorption, lower serum triglycerides, and reduce A1c by 0.8%.
  * Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) Inhibitors: Block glucose reabsorption in the renal tubule, increase urinary glucose excretion, reduce A1c by 0.5-1%.
* Initial Treatment for Type 1 and DKA: Always insulin, with differences based on onset and duration of action.
* Treatment Goals for Older Adults: Consider health beliefs, life expectancy, functional status, economic situation, and support services.
* Response to Treatment: Based on home BG monitoring and HbA1c, with follow-up visits including BP, BMI, foot exams, annual eye exams, and various lab tests.
* Weight Loss Recommendations: In obese adults, a 5-10% total body weight loss can improve glycemic control and delay DM2.
* Risk Factors for Developing DM2: Age ≥ 45, family history, race, hyperlipidemia, history of GDM, PCOS, obesity, smoking, HTN, and more.
* Risk Factors in the Elderly: Increased abdominal fat, decreased physical activity, sarcopenia, mitochondrial dysfunction, and hormonal changes.

#### Complications of DM

* Macrovascular: CAD, stroke, PVD.
* HbA1c > 13%, Fasting BG > 300 mg/dL: Can lead to altered behavior, seizures, coma.
* Atherosclerosis, HLD, Retinopathy, Depression, DKA, Blindness, HTN, Sexual Problems: Common complications.
* End-Stage Renal Disease, Lower Extremity Amputations, Slow Wound Healing: Severe complications.

#### Treatments for Complications

* ACE Inhibitors: Postpone microalbuminuria and nephropathy progression.
* Daily Aspirin: Reduces CVD risks.
* Obesity Management: Through diet, exercise, and possibly surgery.
* Lifestyle Management: Includes nutritional education, sleep hygiene, stress reduction, and smoking cessation.
* Hypoglycemia Management: Treat with juice, soda, or milk if BG \< 70; BG \< 54 is considered severe.
