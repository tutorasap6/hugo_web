### Assessment (A):

Primary Diagnosis:

* Hypothyroidism, Unspecified (ICD-10: E03.9): Considering the weight gain, fatigue, and decreased interest in activities despite dieting and exercise, hypothyroidism is a likely diagnosis. Hypothyroidism commonly presents with symptoms such as weight gain, fatigue, and depression.

Secondary Diagnoses:

1. Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Moderate (ICD-10: F32.1): The patient’s feelings of worthlessness, decreased energy, and lack of interest in usual activities suggest the possibility of a depressive disorder.
2. Obesity (ICD-10: E66.9): Given the recent weight gain and the patient’s BMI, obesity is a consideration that requires further evaluation and management.

***

### Diagnostic Testing:

1. Thyroid Function Tests (TSH, Free T4):
   * To confirm or rule out hypothyroidism as the cause of the patient’s symptoms.
2. Complete Blood Count (CBC):
   * To rule out anemia or other hematologic conditions that might be contributing to fatigue.
3. Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP):
   * To evaluate overall metabolic function, including liver and kidney function, as well as electrolyte levels.
4. Lipid Panel:
   * Given the patient's history of HTN and weight gain, a lipid panel would be useful to assess cardiovascular risk.
5. Psychiatric Evaluation:
   * A full psychiatric evaluation is recommended to assess the severity of depressive symptoms and to develop an appropriate treatment plan.

***

### Plan (P):

1. Medications:
   * Levothyroxine if hypothyroidism is confirmed.
   * Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) if depressive disorder is confirmed.
2. Lifestyle Modifications:
   * Continue with smoking cessation support.
   * Encourage a balanced diet and regular physical activity.
3. Follow-Up:
   * Re-evaluate in 4-6 weeks to assess response to treatment and adjust medications as necessary.
4. Referrals:
   * Referral to a dietitian for weight management.
   * Referral to a mental health professional for counseling and support.
5. Patient Education:
   * Educate the patient on the importance of adhering to prescribed medications and lifestyle changes.
   * Discuss the potential long-term complications of untreated hypothyroidism and depression.
