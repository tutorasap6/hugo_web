### NR341 Content Review Exam 2

#### Chapter 8: Hemodynamics

Blood Flow to Tissues and Organs

* Tests include capillary refill, BP, O2 stats, urinary output, HR, and BP (monitor systolic BP if it is below 90).

Central Line Associated Bloodstream Infection (CLABSI) Bundle:

* Hand hygiene
* Full barrier precautions: Cover the patient from head to foot
* Chlorhexidine skin antisepsis: Unless the patient is allergic (Betadine can be used)
* Optimal catheter site selection: Subclavian, Femoral, Internal jugular
* Dressing
* Safe disposal of sharps
* Daily review of line necessity: Ensure the patient actually needs a central line
  * Reasons for central line:
    * TPN (Total Parenteral Nutrition)
    * Dialysis
    * Drip (pressors)
    * Monitoring CVP (Central Venous Pressure)

Central Venous Pressure (CVP)

* How assessed: Obtained from a central line (IJ or subclavian) in the vena cava; measures right atrial pressures and assesses preload on the right side of the heart.
* Normal levels: 2-6 mmHg
* Causes of abnormal levels:
  * Hypovolemia
  * Heart failure
  * Hypervolemia
  * Cardiac tamponade
  * Pulmonary embolism
  * Pleural effusion
* Treatment:
  * Low CVP: Fluids, Blood
  * High CVP: Dialysis, Diuretics

#### Chapter 12: Shock, Sepsis, and Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome

Stages of Shock:

* Stage 1: Hypoperfusion Stage
  * Checking cardiac output is the only way to identify this stage
* Stage 2: Compensatory Stage
  * Blood pressure decreases slightly, heart rate increases slightly
  * Sympathetic nervous system secretes epinephrine and norepinephrine, causing vasoconstriction
    * Cold extremities
    * Skin: Body uses blood from skin to compensate, risk of pressure ulcers
    * GI: Peptic ulcers, decreased peristalsis, paralytic ileus
    * Kidney: Decreased urine output
    * Liver
  * Cortisol secretion from adrenal glands (above kidneys)
    * Secretions: aldosterone, cortisol, sex hormones
    * Blood sugar increases
* Stage 3: Progressive Shock
  * Anaerobic metabolism, high lactic acid
  * Dysrhythmias due to sodium-potassium pump malfunction
  * Body starts to swell
  * Brain ischemia: Infarction
* Stage 4: Refractory Shock
  * Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS)

Hypovolemic Shock:

* Causes:
  * Blood loss
  * Excessive water loss
* Signs and Symptoms:
  * Low BP
  * Increased HR
  * Low CVP
  * Cool skin
* Treatment:
  * Replace blood or fluids

Anaphylactic Shock:

* Causes:
  * Hypersensitivity (e.g., peanuts)
* Signs and Symptoms:
  * Extreme inflammation
  * Low BP
  * High HR
  * CVP unaffected
  * Warm skin
* Treatment:
  * Epinephrine

Cardiogenic Shock:

* Causes:
  * Trauma to the heart (e.g., MI)
* Signs and Symptoms:
  * Low BP
  * High HR
  * High CVP
  * Cool skin
* Medications to treat:
  * Diuretics
  * Vasodilators
  * Dobutamine (increases cardiac contractility)
  * Balloon pump
  * LVAD (Left Ventricular Assist Device)

Septic Shock:

* Signs and Symptoms (need 2 or more to be considered sepsis):
  * Temperature >38째C or \<36째C (or >100.4째F or \<95째F)
  * HR >90
  * Respirations >20 or CO2 \<32
  * WBC >12,000 or \<4,000
  * Bandemia (presence of baby neutrophils)
* Sepsis Bundle:
  * Measure lactic acid levels (indicative of anaerobic metabolism)
    * Normal: \<2
    * Abnormal: >2
