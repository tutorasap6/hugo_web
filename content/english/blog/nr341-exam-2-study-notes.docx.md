### Heart Failure

Inability to Generate Adequate Flow:

* Systolic Heart Failure: Impaired contractility
* Diastolic Heart Failure: Impaired filling

Progression:

* Typically leads to left-sided heart failure occurring first.

Heart Compensation Mechanisms:

* Hypertrophy:
  * Cardiac wall thickens, muscle mass increases due to increased workload, leading to increased oxygen demand for heart muscle/tissue.
* Dilation:
  * Chambers enlarge due to increased blood volume, muscle fibers stretch to increase contraction force.

BNP (B-type Natriuretic Peptide):

* A cardiac hormone secreted by ventricular myocytes due to wall stretching.
  * Normal: \<100 pg/mL
  * Heart Failure: Increased BNP
    * Treatment for Increased BNP:
      * Diuretics
      * Digoxin (helps heart pump stronger, slows HR)
      * Beta blockers (helps heart pump better, decreases BP and HR)
      * ACE inhibitors (decreases BP and heart resistance to assist heart to pump better)
      * Sodium restriction
      * Fluid restriction
  * Treated Heart Failure: Decreased BNP
  * Differentiates Pulmonary and Cardiac Causes of Dyspnea

Right-Sided Heart Failure:

* Impaired Right Ventricle: Leads to backup of blood in the right ventricle, right atrium, and systemic circulation.
  * Increased central venous pressure
  * JVD (jugular vein distention)
  * Peripheral edema
  * Hepatomegaly and RUQ tenderness
  * Portal hypertension
  * Ascites (congestion in the liver)
  * S3 and S4 heart sounds

Left-Sided Heart Failure:

* Impaired Left Ventricle: Leads to backup of blood in the left ventricle, left atrium, pulmonary veins, and lungs.
  * Increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure
  * Adventitious breath sounds (crackles, rales)
  * Exertional dyspnea
  * Orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
  * Cough
  * A-fib secondary to atrial distention
  * Pulsus alternans (every other beat is diminished)
  * S3 heart sounds

Treatment for Heart Failure (Mnemonics: UNLOAD FAST):

* Upright Position
* Nitrates
* Lasix
* Oxygen
* ACE Inhibitors
* Digoxin
* Fluids Decreased
* Afterload Decreased
* Sodium Restriction
* Tests: Digoxin level, ABGs, K+ level
* BNP = Nesiritide Citrate (Natrecor): Short-term treatment for acute HF

Heart Failure Complications:

* Pulmonary Edema:
  * Dyspnea
  * Cyanosis
  * Gurgles
  * Pink, frothy sputum
  * Hypoxemia
* Cardiogenic Shock: Unable to supply body with necessary oxygen demands.
  * Decreased LOC
  * Decreased output
  * Hypotension

### Inflammatory Heart Disease

Pericarditis:

* Inflammation of the Pericardium
  * Causes: Viruses, MI, rheumatic fever, trauma, uremia, cancers, idiopathic
  * Complications: Effusion, tamponade, scarring
  * Signs and Symptoms:
    * Pleuritic chest pain (increases with coughing, swallowing, inspiration)
    * Pain relieved when sitting up and leaning forward
    * Fever, chills (may or may not be present)
    * Leukocytosis
    * Pericardial friction rub
    * ST segment elevation in all leads with 12-lead EKG (indicative of inflammation)
