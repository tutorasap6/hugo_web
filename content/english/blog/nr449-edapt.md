### Parts of a Research Study Where Bias Can Occur

* Planning the Study
* Selecting Participants
* Seeking Funding
* Reporting the Results
* Conducting the Study

Note: Bias can be an issue in every stage and part of a research study.

***

### Validity vs. Reliability

* Quality Evidence: Just because a research article sounds professional, uses technical language, is authored by experts, and reports impressive results, it does not necessarily mean it is credible.
  * Example: A 1998 study published in a peer-reviewed journal claimed a link between the MMR vaccine and autism, which was later proven to be critically flawed but had already caused significant mistrust in vaccines.

### Which Situation is Not Possible?

* High Reliability and High Validity: Possible
* High Reliability and Low Validity: Possible
* Low Reliability and High Validity: Not Possible
* Low Reliability and Low Validity: Possible

Explanation: To be valid, a measurement or instrument must also be reliable. Therefore, low reliability cannot coexist with high validity.

***

### Types of Validity

* Internal Validity: The study establishes a trustworthy cause-and-effect relationship between a treatment and an outcome.
* External Validity: How the study results are applicable in other settings or the generalizability of the study results.
* Construct Validity: Does the test measure what it is supposed to measure?
* Content Validity: Are the test items fully representative of the entire domain they are intended to measure?
* Conclusion Validity: The conclusions of the study are reasonable.

***

### Types of Reliability

* Concept: Reliability refers to the consistency of measurement. A reliable measure can be replicated.
* Example Issue: In a qualitative study using coding as a method, if two researchers reach different conclusions on the codes applied to interview transcript data, it is an issue of reliability.
