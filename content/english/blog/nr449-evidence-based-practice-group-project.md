### Slide 1: Title Slide

* Title: NR449: Evidence-Based Practice Group Project
* Subtitle: Prevention of Early Hospital Readmissions
* Presented by: \[Your Group Members' Names]
* Date: \[Date of Presentation]

***

### Slide 2: Identification of the Problem

* Title: Understanding Early Hospital Readmissions
* Content:
  * Definition: A hospital readmission that occurs within 30 days of a patientâ€™s original discharge date.
  * Impact on Patients: Disrupts recovery, increases risk of complications, and reduces quality of life.
  * Impact on Healthcare Facilities: Financial penalties under the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP) of 2012, impacts hospital reputation and resource allocation.
  * At-Risk Population: Geriatric patients are especially vulnerable due to the prevalence of multiple chronic conditions (comorbidities).
  * Research Question: For geriatric populations, does ensuring appropriate follow-up care post-discharge reduce the risk of hospital readmission compared with providing discharge teaching alone?

***

### Slide 3: Research Process - PICO Framework

* Title: Structuring the Research Question
* Content:
  * PICO Components:
    * Population (P): Older adults (geriatric population).
    * Intervention (I): Ensuring appropriate follow-up care after discharge.
    * Comparison (C): Standard discharge teaching alone without additional follow-up.
    * Outcome (O): Reduction in the rate of early hospital readmissions.

***

### Slide 4: Research Process - Search Strategies

* Title: Conducting a Comprehensive Literature Search
* Content:
  * Access Point: Chamberlain University Library website.
  * Search Terms: Keywords related to early hospital readmissions, geriatric care, follow-up care, and discharge processes.
  * Filters Applied:
    * Publication Date: Focus on recent studies to ensure relevance.
    * Full Text Availability: Only include studies with accessible full texts online.
    * Peer-reviewed Journals: Ensuring credibility and reliability of the sources.

***

### Slide 5: Barriers Encountered During Research

* Title: Challenges in the Research Process
* Content:
  * High Volume of Publications: Difficulty in narrowing down relevant studies due to the large number of available articles.
  * Complexity of Variables: A lack of studies focusing on single-variable analysis made it challenging to isolate the impact of follow-up care versus discharge teaching alone.
  * Overlapping Research: Many studies combined multiple interventions, complicating the analysis of specific outcomes.

***

### Slide 6: Successes in the Research Process

* Title: What Worked Well
* Content:
  * Identifying Relevant Articles: Successful in locating key studies on follow-up care and its impact on readmission rates.
  * Effective Group Collaboration: Strong communication among group members facilitated the sharing of findings and ideas.
  * Database Utilization: Efficient use of academic databases helped streamline the search process and retrieve high-quality sources.

***

### Slide 7: Information Still Needed

* Title: Gaps in the Current Research
* Content:
  * Further Evidence on Discharge Teaching: More studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of discharge teaching alone in preventing readmissions.
  * Longitudinal Data: Lack of long-term follow-up studies that track patient outcomes beyond 30 days post-discharge.
  * Comparison of Interventions: A need for more comparative studies that directly contrast follow-up care with discharge teaching.

***

### Slide 8: Summary of Evidence - Qualitative Studies

* Title: Insights from Qualitative Research
* Content:
  * Article 1: Preventing Readmissions Through Transitional Care
    * Methodology: Case study approach, utilized a scholarly database for literature review.
    * Key Findings: Emphasized the role of transitional care in reducing readmission rates by addressing patient needs post-discharge.
  * Article 2: Impact of a Transition Nurse Program on 30-Day Hospital Readmissions of Elderly Patients
    * Methodology: Quasi-experimental, multicenter, stepped-wedge randomized trial.
    * Sample Size: 630 patients.
    * Key Findings: Demonstrated a significant reduction in readmissions through the implementation of a dedicated transition nurse program.
  * Article 3: Hospital Readmission Among Elderly Patients
    * Methodology: Focus group discussions.
    * Key Findings: Identified common challenges faced by elderly patients post-discharge, such as medication management and follow-up care.

***

### Slide 9: Summary of Evidence - Qualitative Studies Continued

* Title: Additional Qualitative Evidence
* Content:
  * Article 4: Development of a Complex Intervention to Reduce Readmission Risk
    * Methodology: Focus groups, purposive sampling to maximize result accuracy.
    * Key Findings: Developed a multifaceted intervention plan aimed at reducing readmissions among elderly patients discharged from the emergency department.

***

### Slide 10: Summary of Evidence - Quantitative Studies

* Title: Insights from Quantitative Research
* Content:
  * Article: Association of Vital Signs and Process Outcomes in Emergency Department Patients
    * Methodology: Psychometric data analysis.
    * Key Findings: Measured the probability of readmission based on vital signs and other process outcomes at the time of ED discharge. Identified vital signs as key indicators of potential readmission risk.

***

### Slide 11: Summary of Evidence - Mixed Design Studies

* Title: Combining Qualitative and Quantitative Approaches
* Content:
  * Article: Causes and Correlates of 30-Day and 180-Day Readmission Following Discharge from Elderly Rehabilitation Units
    * Methodology: Mixed-design study, combining both qualitative interviews and quantitative data analysis.
    * Key Findings: Explored the complex interplay of factors contributing to short-term (30-day) and longer-term (180-day) readmissions, highlighting the importance of continuous care and monitoring.

***

### Slide 12: Conclusion

* Title: Key Takeaways and Implications for Practice
* Content:
  * Importance of Follow-Up Care: Evidence strongly supports the role of comprehensive follow-up care in reducing early hospital readmissions among geriatric patients.
  * Need for Further Research: Identified gaps in current research, particularly regarding the effectiveness of discharge teaching alone.
  * Clinical Implications: Emphasizes the need for healthcare providers to integrate follow-up care as a standard practice for high-risk populations, particularly the elderly.

***

### Slide 13: Questions and Discussion

* Title: Questions?
* Content:
  * Open the floor for questions and engage the audience in a discussion about the findings and their implications for nursing practice.
