### NR 451 RN Capstone Course

Capstone Project Milestone #2: Design for Change Proposal Guidelines

***

Purpose:

The purpose of this assignment is to develop a comprehensive Design for Change proposal that incorporates your PICOT question and evidence appraisal information from Milestone #1. The goal is to persuade your management team about a significant nursing problem you have identified, demonstrating the need for change in current practice. If you are not currently employed as a nurse, you can base your proposal on a hypothetical clinical situation or a nursing education issue encountered during your nursing program. This proposal will be a critical step in advocating for evidence-based practice changes that can lead to improved patient outcomes and enhanced care delivery.

***

Course Outcomes:

This assignment enables the student to achieve the following course outcomes:

* CO1: Apply the theories and principles of nursing and related disciplines to individuals, families, aggregates, and communities from entry into the healthcare system through long-term planning. (PO #1)
* CO2: Propose leadership and collaboration strategies for use with consumers and other healthcare providers in managing care and/or delegating responsibilities for health promotion, illness prevention, health restoration and maintenance, and rehabilitative activities. (PO #2)

***

Due Date:

* Submit Milestone #2, the Design for Change Capstone Project proposal, to the Dropbox by the end of Week 4. It is essential to adhere to this deadline to allow sufficient time for review and feedback, which will be crucial for refining your project.

***

Points:

* Milestone #2 is worth 225 points. This substantial portion of your grade underscores the importance of this assignment in your overall capstone project. It is essential to approach this task with diligence and thoroughness.

Directions:

1. Proposal Creation:
   * Develop a Persuasive Proposal:
     Your proposal should convincingly present the nursing problem you have identified, explaining why it is significant enough to necessitate a change in current practice. Use evidence from Milestone #1, particularly your PICOT question and the evidence appraisal, to build a strong case.
   * Use the Provided Template:
     Open the template provided in Doc Sharing. This template will guide you in organizing your content logically and ensuring that all required components are included.
   * Leverage Evidence-Based Practice:
     Use evidence-based practice as the foundation for your proposal. Your argument should be rooted in the latest research and clinical guidelines, demonstrating how the proposed change is supported by strong evidence and how it will lead to better patient outcomes.
2. Format:
   * APA Formatting:
     The proposal should be formatted as a scholarly paper following the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (APA), 6th edition. This includes appropriate citations, references, headings, and a professional tone throughout the document.
   * Structured Content:
     Organize your paper with clear sections that logically flow from one to the next. Ensure that each section builds upon the previous one, leading the reader through your thought process and supporting your argument for change.
3. Length:
   * Four to Six Pages:
     The paper should be between four to six pages long, excluding the Title page and Reference page. Ensure that your writing is concise yet comprehensive, covering all necessary aspects without being overly verbose.
4. Content Organization:
   * Introduction:
     * Write a compelling introduction that sets the stage for your proposal. Introduce the reader to the nursing problem you have identified, supported by evidence from your PICOT question and literature review. Provide context that highlights the significance of the issue in your clinical setting or educational environment.
   * PICOT Question:
     * Clearly articulate your PICOT question, which should guide the focus of your proposal. Ensure that the question is specific, measurable, and relevant to the problem you are addressing.
   * Evidence Appraisal:
     * Summarize the evidence you gathered in Milestone #1, focusing on how it supports the need for change. Discuss the quality and relevance of the evidence, highlighting key studies or data that demonstrate the potential benefits of the proposed change.
   * Proposed Change:
     * Detail the change you are proposing. Explain how this change addresses the identified problem and why it is necessary. Discuss the anticipated impact of the change on patient care, nursing practice, and overall outcomes. Include a rationale for why this change is the best solution, considering alternative approaches and their limitations.
   * Implementation Plan:
     * Outline a detailed implementation plan, including the steps needed to execute the change. Discuss the resources required, including staffing, training, and materials. Provide a realistic timeline for implementation, identifying key milestones and deadlines. Consider potential barriers to implementation and how they will be addressed.
   * Evaluation:
     * Describe how the success of the change will be measured. Identify specific metrics that will be used to evaluate the outcomes, such as patient satisfaction, readmission rates, or nursing efficiency. Discuss the tools and methods that will be used to collect and analyze data. Include a plan for ongoing monitoring and adjustments as needed.
5. Submission:
   * Proofread and Review:
     Before submitting your proposal, thoroughly proofread your paper for grammar, spelling, and formatting errors. Ensure that all APA formatting requirements are met and that your references are correctly cited. Consider asking a peer or mentor to review your work for clarity and coherence.
   * Submit to Dropbox:
     Upload your completed proposal to the designated Dropbox by the end of Week 4. Ensure that you submit the correct document and verify the submission to avoid any technical issues.

Comprehensive Proposal Development:

* Developing a Strong Argument:
  Craft your proposal to be as persuasive as possible, using a combination of evidence, logical reasoning, and practical considerations. Your goal is to convince your management team that the proposed change is not only necessary but also feasible and likely to result in significant improvements.
* Engage Your Audience:
  Write with your management team in mind, addressing potential concerns and emphasizing the benefits of the proposed change. Use clear, direct language and support your arguments with data and examples.
* Reflect on Broader Implications:
  Consider the broader implications of your proposed change for the nursing profession, healthcare system, and patient populations. Discuss how your project aligns with current trends in healthcare and nursing practice.
* Consider Ethical and Legal Factors:
  Address any ethical or legal considerations related to your proposed change. Ensure that your proposal adheres to professional standards and regulatory requirements.
