Research Question:
Does the use of a formal mentoring program for new graduate nurses have a positive effect on their self-confidence and retention?

***

1. Population (P):
   New graduate nurses
2. Intervention (I):
   Formal mentoring program
3. Comparison (C):
   What is the current practice you are comparing to "I"? (This element may be implied or missing):
   * Current Practice: Absence of a formal mentoring program or informal orientation processes
4. Outcome (O):
   * Increased self-confidence among new graduate nurses
   * Improved retention rates of new graduate nurses
5. Timeframe (T):
   * Is there a need to limit the timeframe for the intervention?
   * Timeframe: Not applicable (N/A)

***

### Search Techniques:

1. Databases:
   What three databases in the CCN library best address your research question?
   * CINAHL: For nursing and allied health literature
   * Cochrane Library: For systematic reviews and evidence-based practice resources
   * Medline (via PubMed): For biomedical and health-related literature
2. Search Terms and Strategies:
   * Subject Headings:
     * Use headings such as "Mentoring," "Nurse Retention," "New Graduate Nurses," and "Self-Confidence."
   * Boolean Search:
     * Combine terms using Boolean operators (e.g., "Mentoring AND Nurse Retention," "New Graduate Nurses AND Self-Confidence").
   * Limiters:
     * After obtaining a reasonable number of relevant search results (10-30), apply additional limiters such as:
       * English Language: To ensure all studies are accessible.
       * Publication Year: Focus on studies published within the last 5-10 years.
       * Peer-Reviewed Journals: To ensure the credibility and quality of the studies.
       * Human Subjects: To ensure relevance to nursing practice.

### Literature Review Worksheet

Purpose:
To find evidence to support an intervention that will change the outcomes for new graduate nurses, focusing on mentoring programs to enhance their self-confidence and retention rates.

***

1. Search Question:
   Does the use of a formal mentoring program for new graduate nurses have a positive effect on their self-confidence and retention?
2. Studies Selection:
   * Requirement: Find at least six (6) studies to support the need for change and the potential effectiveness of a formal mentoring program for new graduate nurses.
   * Selection Criteria:
     * Focus on studies that examine the impact of mentoring on nurse retention and self-confidence.
     * Include systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and qualitative studies that explore the experiences of new graduate nurses.
     * Prioritize recent, peer-reviewed articles that offer strong evidence to support the intervention.

***

### Next Steps:

* Summarize Findings: After selecting the six studies, summarize the key findings from each study in terms of how they support the use of formal mentoring programs for new graduate nurses.
* Synthesize Evidence: Identify common themes across the studies and discuss how the evidence supports the proposed intervention.
