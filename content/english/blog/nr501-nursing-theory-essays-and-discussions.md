# NR501 Nursing Theory Essays and Discussions

## Week 1 Discussion: Importance of Theory in Nursing

### Debate on the Importance of Nursing Theory

For many students enrolled in NR501, this is an initial course for nursing theory. So, let’s have a debate! Is nursing theory important to the nursing profession? If you believe that it is important, explain why it is useful. If you do not believe that it is useful, explain why nursing theory is not necessary for the profession. Be sure to provide an example that demonstrates your opinion and a scholarly reference (not using the required textbook or lesson) which supports your opinion.

### Importance of Nursing Theory

Nursing theory is crucial to the nursing profession for several reasons. It helps define the discipline, provides a framework for research and practice, and supports the development of new roles within nursing (Im & Chung, 2012). For example, nursing theories like Jean Watson's Theory of Human Caring guide nurses in providing compassionate and patient-centered care, which enhances patient outcomes and satisfaction. By establishing nursing as a distinct profession, theory ensures that nursing practices are based on critically appraised science (Power, 2016).

## Week 2 Discussion: Significance of Nursing Concepts within the Profession

### Metaparadigm of Nursing

This discussion considers the metaparadigm of nursing and the four concepts of the nursing profession—person, environment, health, and nursing. Select a practice area of the nursing profession (e.g., education, executive, informatics, healthcare policy, or advanced clinical practice) and apply each of the four concepts to the selected area. Include an example that demonstrates the application to the practice area and support your initial posting with scholarly references.

## Week 3 Discussion: Steps of Concept Analysis

### Concept Analysis Preparation

At the end of Week 4, your concept analysis is due. This discussion provides an opportunity to start this assignment. Select a nursing concept (be sure to use a nursing theory) and then provide a response to each step included in a concept analysis regarding your selected concept. This information does not have to be comprehensive but provides a foundation for the upcoming assignment. Include a scholarly reference.

## Week 4 Discussion: Connection Between Theory and Advanced Clinical Practice

### Role of Nursing Theory in Clinical Practice

While the focus of this course is nursing theory, some nurses argue that theory has no role in clinical practice. What are your thoughts? Does nursing theory have a role in clinical practice? How would you use nursing theory to improve or evaluate the quality of clinical practice? Include an example to illustrate your thoughts and a scholarly reference.

## Week 5 Discussion: Borrowed (Non-Nursing) Theories Applied to the Nursing Profession

### Application of Borrowed Theories

While the focus of this course is nursing theory, frequently the use of non-nursing or borrowed theories occurs. Select a nursing practice area (e.g., education, executive, advanced clinical practice, informatics, or healthcare policy); then identify a non-nursing (borrowed) theory and apply it to the selected area. Provide an example of how the non-nursing theory can be used to enhance the selected practice area and support your information with scholarly references.

## Week 6 Discussion: Impact of Nursing Theory Upon Healthcare Organization

### Application of Middle-Range Nursing Theory

Discuss how a specific middle-range nursing theory has been or could be applied by nurse leaders or nurse managers to effectively address an administrative issue (e.g., staffing, use of supplies, staff performance issues). Include an example from the literature or your own experience to illustrate your points.

## Week 7 Discussion: Nursing Theory Applied to Research

### Application of Nursing Theory to PICOT Format

In NR 500, you developed a PICOT question. Select a nursing theory that you find useful in nursing practice. Discuss how your selected nursing theory can guide the elements of the PICOT format:

* Population/Patient Problem: How does your nursing theory guide the selection of the population or patient problem?
* Intervention: Does your nursing theory suggest a possible intervention? How is your selected intervention consistent with your nursing theory?
* Outcome: How would the outcome of your PICOT study contribute to your nursing theory? Would it add new information or confirm some part of the theory?
  Include a scholarly reference.

## Week 8 Discussion: Course Reflection and Future Application

### Reflection on Nursing Theory Application

Throughout the discussions in NR501, the common element has been the application of theory. As we conclude, focus on your future practice area, considering your capstone project. Select one nursing theory that you prefer and answer the following questions:

1. Why do you prefer the nursing theory you selected?
2. How can this theory be used in your current practice area (education, executive, advanced clinical practice, informatics, or healthcare policy)?
3. How can this theory be used in your future practice area (education, executive, advanced clinical practice, informatics, or healthcare policy)?
