### Epidemiological Formulas and Statistics

#### Relative Risk Calculation

Parameter Definitions and Formulas:

1. Incidence=Number of New CasesPopulation at Risk\text{Incidence} = \frac{\text{Number of New Cases}}{\text{Population at Risk}}Incidence=Population at RiskNumber of New Cases​
2. RR=Incidence Rate in Exposed GroupIncidence Rate in Unexposed Group\text{RR} = \frac{\text{Incidence Rate in Exposed Group}}{\text{Incidence Rate in Unexposed Group}}RR=Incidence Rate in Unexposed GroupIncidence Rate in Exposed Group​
3. OR=(Odds of Disease in Exposed Group)(Odds of Disease in Unexposed Group)\text{OR} = \frac{\text{(Odds of Disease in Exposed Group)}}{\text{(Odds of Disease in Unexposed Group)}}OR=(Odds of Disease in Unexposed Group)(Odds of Disease in Exposed Group)​
4. Prevalence=Number of Existing CasesTotal Population\text{Prevalence} = \frac{\text{Number of Existing Cases}}{\text{Total Population}}Prevalence=Total PopulationNumber of Existing Cases​
5. AR=Incidence in Exposed Group−Incidence in Unexposed Group\text{AR} = \text{Incidence in Exposed Group} - \text{Incidence in Unexposed Group}AR=Incidence in Exposed Group−Incidence in Unexposed Group
6. PAR=Incidence in Total Population−Incidence in Unexposed GroupIncidence in Total Population\text{PAR} = \frac{\text{Incidence in Total Population} - \text{Incidence in Unexposed Group}}{\text{Incidence in Total Population}}PAR=Incidence in Total PopulationIncidence in Total Population−Incidence in Unexposed Group​
7. SD=∑(Xi−Xˉ)2N−1\text{SD} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (X\_i - \bar{X})^2}{N - 1}}SD=N−1∑(Xi​−Xˉ)2​​where XiX\_iXi​ represents each value, Xˉ\bar{X}Xˉ is the mean of the values, and NNN is the number of values.
8. CI=Estimate±(Critical Value)×Standard Error\text{CI} = \text{Estimate} \pm \text{(Critical Value)} \times \text{Standard Error}CI=Estimate±(Critical Value)×Standard Error
9. P-value
   Definition: The probability of obtaining a result at least as extreme as the one observed, under the null hypothesis.
   Formula:
   Calculated through statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, chi-square tests).
