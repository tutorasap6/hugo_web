### Health Policy Analysis: Suicide Prevention in Alaska Native Villages

### Problem Statement:

How can primary care providers prevent suicide in Alaska Native villages?

### Background:

Suicide rates among American Indian and Alaska Native populations, particularly among youth and young adults aged 15â€“24, are alarmingly high. According to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (2019), the Alaska Violent Death Reporting System (AKVDRS) recorded 1,103 suicides between 2012 and 2017. Among these cases, 37% of the decedents had a documented current mental health problem, and 36% had a documented alcohol and/or substance abuse problem. These statistics highlight the critical need for effective suicide prevention strategies in Alaska Native villages, where primary care providers (PCPs) and behavioral health providers play a pivotal role.

### Landscape:

Primary Care Providers (PCPs):Primary care providers in Alaska Native villages are often the first point of contact for individuals at risk of suicide. Their role in suicide prevention includes screening for mental health issues, substance abuse, and other risk factors. They are also responsible for initiating appropriate interventions, such as referrals to behavioral health services or the implementation of safety plans. Given the limited access to specialized care in remote villages, PCPs must be equipped with the necessary skills and resources to address suicide risk effectively.

Behavioral Health Providers:Behavioral health providers are essential in the management and treatment of individuals with mental health and substance abuse issues. In Alaska Native villages, these providers work closely with primary care teams to deliver culturally appropriate care. Their role includes offering counseling, therapy, and support to individuals and families affected by suicide. Collaboration between PCPs and behavioral health providers is crucial for creating a comprehensive and effective suicide prevention strategy.

### Policy Recommendations:

1. Enhance Training for PCPs:
   * Implement specialized training programs for primary care providers to improve their ability to identify and manage suicide risk among Alaska Native populations. This training should focus on cultural competence, mental health first aid, and the integration of behavioral health into primary care.
2. Strengthen Collaboration:
   * Foster stronger collaboration between primary care and behavioral health providers. Integrated care models, where PCPs and behavioral health providers work together in a coordinated manner, should be promoted to ensure comprehensive care for at-risk individuals.
3. Increase Access to Behavioral Health Services:
   * Expand access to behavioral health services in Alaska Native villages by leveraging telehealth technologies and increasing the number of behavioral health providers available in these communities. This approach can help bridge the gap in care for individuals living in remote areas.
4. Implement Community-Based Interventions:
   * Support community-based suicide prevention programs that involve local leaders, elders, and community members. These programs should focus on building resilience, reducing stigma around mental health, and promoting the use of available resources.
5. Policy Advocacy:
   * Advocate for state and federal policies that allocate resources and funding to suicide prevention initiatives in Alaska Native villages. This includes funding for mental health services, substance abuse programs, and training for healthcare providers.

### Conclusion:

Addressing the high rates of suicide in Alaska Native villages requires a multifaceted approach that involves primary care providers, behavioral health providers, and the community. By enhancing the skills and collaboration of healthcare providers, increasing access to behavioral health services, and implementing culturally sensitive interventions, we can work towards reducing suicide rates and improving the overall well-being of Alaska Native populations.
