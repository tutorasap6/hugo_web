### Slide 2: Introduction

* Overview:
  * This presentation will discuss the scope of practice for Nurse Practitioners (NPs) in Nebraska (NE).
  * Focus on levels of independence, prescribing authority, limitations, and certification/education requirements.
  * Impact of Full Practice Authority (FPA) on patient access to care in rural areas.

***

### Slide 3: Full Practice Authority in Nebraska

* Key Legislation:
  * Governor Pete Ricketts signed LB 107 into law on March 5, 2015.
  * This legislation granted Full Practice Authority (FPA) to Nurse Practitioners in Nebraska (Sundermeier, 2015).
* Definition:
  * According to the American Association of Nurse Practitioners (AANP), FPA allows NPs to evaluate patients, diagnose conditions, interpret diagnostic tests, initiate treatment plans, and prescribe medications independently (Dillon & Gary, 2017).

***

### Slide 4: Level of Independence

* Autonomy in Practice:
  * Nebraska NPs have full independence in their scope of practice under FPA.
  * They can provide care without physician oversight, particularly critical in rural and underserved areas.
* Impact:
  * The independence of NPs has significantly improved patient access to care in rural regions of Nebraska.

***

### Slide 5: Prescribing Authority

* Full Prescriptive Authority:
  * NPs in Nebraska can prescribe both legend drugs and controlled substances as part of their licensure (American Medical Association, 2017).
* Responsibility:
  * NPs must adhere to prescriptive rules and regulations and commit to ongoing pharmacotherapeutic education (Blair, 2018).

***

### Slide 6: Limitations of Practice

* Durable Medical Equipment (DME) Restrictions:
  * Unlike other states, Nebraska Medicaid does not authorize NPs to prescribe Durable Medical Equipment (DME) despite CMS guidelines (Nebraska Nurse Practitioners, n.d.).
* Impact:
  * This restriction presents a barrier to accessing necessary home care equipment, particularly for underserved populations.

***

### Slide 7: Certification and Education Requirements

* Graduate-Level Education:
  * NPs must complete an approved graduate-level nursing or NP program, including 30 hours of pharmacotherapeutics education specific to Nebraska (DHHS, 2020).
* National Certification:
  * After completing their education, NPs must pass a national certifying exam and maintain active board certification (DHHS, 2020).
* Approved Certifying Bodies:
  * American Association of Critical-Care Nurses (AACN)
  * American Association of Nurse Practitioners (AANP)
  * American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC)
  * National Certification Corporation (NCC)
  * Pediatric Nursing Certification Board (PNCB)

***

### Slide 8: Impact of Full Practice Authority on Patient Care

* Rural and Underserved Areas:
  * Nebraska has many rural communities classified as geographically isolated by HRSA.
  * Full Practice Authority allows NPs to provide essential healthcare services in these areas where physician shortages are prevalent (Dillon & Gary, 2017).
* Improved Access:
  * FPA enables NPs to meet healthcare demands, reduce travel distances for patients, and prevent gaps in care.

***

### Slide 9: Conclusion

* Summary:
  * Full Practice Authority in Nebraska empowers NPs to practice independently, improving healthcare access, especially in rural areas.
  * Although some limitations exist, such as the DME prescribing restriction, the overall impact of FPA on patient care is positive.
* Future Implications:
  * Continued advocacy for expanded NP roles, particularly in addressing the remaining practice limitations, is essential for further improving healthcare delivery in Nebraska.
