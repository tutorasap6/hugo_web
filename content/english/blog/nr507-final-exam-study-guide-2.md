## (Free Answer) **NR-507 Study Guide**

### 1. Types of Immunity (Chapters 7 & 8)

a. Innate Immunity

* Natural epithelial barriers and inflammation provide innate resistance and protection (pg. 191).

b. Adaptive/Acquired Immunity

* Active (Acquired): Immunity developed after natural exposure to an antigen or through immunization (pg. 227).
* Passive (Acquired): Immunity obtained by transferring preformed antibodies or T lymphocytes from a donor to a recipient, such as from mother to fetus or through a bone marrow transplant (pg. 227).

### 2. Alveolar Ventilation/Perfusion (Ch. 34, pg. 1239)

* The ratio between the amount of air reaching the alveoli and the amount of blood being sent to the lungs.

### 3. Dermatologic Conditions (Chapter 46)

* Pityriasis Rosea:
  A benign, self-limiting inflammatory disorder typically occurring in young adults with seasonal peaks in spring and fall. It can be harmful during pregnancy. The condition is associated with a virus and begins with a herald patch, which is circular, salmon-pink, and well-demarcated, usually appearing on the trunk. Treatments may include acyclovir, erythromycin, and corticosteroid creams for itching. The condition generally resolves within a few months.

### 4. Croup (pg. 1294-1296)

* Croup is a viral infection characterized by a barking cough and typically occurs during the winter and spring months. It usually affects children aged 6 months to 3 years, peaking at 2 years old. Symptoms include stridor, fever, and a duration of 2-5 days. The condition is caused by human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) and RSV, which are airborne. Management includes rest, humidity, and plenty of fluids. Croup is also known as acute laryngotracheobronchitis.

### 5. Types of Anemia (Ch. 28, pg. 982-1102)

* Anemia:
  A reduction in the total number of erythrocytes in the circulating blood or a decrease in the quality or quantity of hemoglobin.

a. Macrocytic-Normochromic Anemia:
Large, abnormally shaped erythrocytes with normal hemoglobin concentrations.
\- Pernicious Anemia: Caused by a lack of vitamin B12, leading to abnormal RNA and DNA synthesis and early cell death.
\- Folate Deficiency Anemia: Caused by a lack of folate necessary for erythropoiesis, leading to premature cell death.

b. Microcytic-Hypochromic Anemia:
Small, abnormally shaped erythrocytes with reduced hemoglobin concentration.
\- Iron Deficiency Anemia: Caused by a lack of iron for hemoglobin production, leading to insufficient hemoglobin synthesis.
\- Sideroblastic Anemia: Caused by dysfunctional iron uptake by erythroblasts and defective porphyrin and heme synthesis.
\- Thalassemia: Caused by impaired synthesis of the alpha or beta chains of hemoglobin, leading to phagocytosis of abnormal erythroblasts in the marrow.

c. Normocytic-Normochromic Anemia:
Normal-sized erythrocytes with normal hemoglobin concentration.
\- Aplastic Anemia: Caused by insufficient erythropoiesis.
\- Posthemorrhagic Anemia: Caused by blood loss.
\- Hemolytic Anemia: Caused by the premature destruction of mature erythrocytes in circulation.
\- Sickle Cell Anemia: Caused by abnormal hemoglobin synthesis, resulting in abnormal cell shape, cell damage, lysis, and phagocytosis.
\- Anemia of Chronic Disease: Caused by an abnormal demand for new erythrocytes.

### 6. The Inflammatory Process Upon Injury (Ch. 7, pg. 195)

* The inflammatory response includes blood vessel dilation, increased vascular permeability, leakage of fluid out of vessels, and WBC adherence to the inner walls of the vessel. These WBCs migrate through vessel walls to the site of injury (Refer to Figure 7-2).

### 7. GI Symptoms Resulting in Heartburn (Ch. 41, pg. 1429)

* Symptoms include acid regurgitation, chronic cough, asthma attacks, laryngitis, upper abdominal pain (within 1 hour of eating), worsened symptoms when lying down, and chest pain.

### 8. Pulmonary Terminology (Ch. 35, pg. 1248)

* Dyspnea: Shortness of breath (SOB).
* Orthopnea: Shortness of breath that occurs when lying flat.

### 9. Complications of Gastric Resection Surgery (pg. 1440)

* A potential complication following gastric resection surgery is dumping syndrome.
