### Case Studies for ECG Interpretation

***

Case 1:

Patient Profile:

* Age/Gender: 21-year-old female
* Presenting Issue: Dental abscess requiring surgical debridement
* Visit Purpose: Pre-operative clearance
* ECG Findings: Slurred upstroke of the QRS complexes
* Symptoms: Denies any cardiac-related symptoms

Diagnosis and Treatment Plan:

* Diagnosis: Consider Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome based on the ECG finding of a slurred upstroke (delta wave).
* Treatment Plan:
  * Preoperative: Ensure the patient is stable for surgery; consider consultation with cardiology.
  * Postoperative: Long-term management may involve medication or ablation therapy depending on the presence of symptoms or arrhythmias.

***

Case 2:

Patient Profile:

* Age/Gender: 34-year-old male
* Visit Purpose: Work physical for a new job as a crane operator
* Medical History: No previous medical history, no current medications
* Lifestyle: Healthy, frequent exerciser, non-smoker, no alcohol intake
* Family History: No family history of cardiac disease
* Blood Pressure:
  * Current Visit: 178/94 mmHg
  * Previous Visit (1 month ago): 168/90 mmHg
* Other Vitals: Within normal limits

Diagnosis and Treatment Plan:

* Diagnosis: Stage 2 hypertension
* Treatment Plan:
  * Lifestyle Modifications: Recommend dietary changes (DASH diet), regular physical activity, and stress management.
  * Medications: Initiate antihypertensive therapy such as ACE inhibitors or beta-blockers.
  * Follow-Up: Regular monitoring of blood pressure and adjustment of therapy as needed.

***

Case 3:

Patient Profile:

* Age/Gender: 68-year-old male
* Presenting Symptoms: Palpitations, lightheadedness, weakness, worsened by alcohol intake
* Medical History: Hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide
* Physical Examination:
  * General Appearance: Uncomfortable
  * Pulse: Irregularly irregular
  * Cardiac Auscultation: First heart sound (S1) of variable intensity
  * Pulmonary Auscultation: Mild bibasilar crackles, absence of peripheral edema
* ECG Findings: To be interpreted

Diagnosis and Treatment Plan:

* Diagnosis: Atrial fibrillation (AFib)
* Treatment Plan:
  * Immediate Management: Rate control with beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers, anticoagulation to prevent thromboembolism.
  * Long-Term Management: Evaluate for rhythm control strategies (e.g., antiarrhythmic drugs, cardioversion), lifestyle modifications to reduce alcohol intake, and regular follow-up with cardiology.
