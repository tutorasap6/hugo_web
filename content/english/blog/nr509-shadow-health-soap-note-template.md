History of Present Illness (HPI)

Chief Complaint (CC): Click or tap here to enter text.
CC is a BRIEF statement identifying why the patient is here – in the patient’s own words – for instance “headache”, NOT “bad headache for 3 days”. Sometimes a patient has more than one complaint. For example: If the patient presents with cough and sore throat, identify which is the CC and which may be an associated symptom.

Shadow Health Assessment Assignment

You will complete all assessment assignments using the Shadow Health virtual reality simulation platform.

Introduction and Pre-brief

Two days after a minor, low-speed car accident in which Tina Jones was a passenger, she noticed daily bilateral headaches along with neck stiffness. She reports that it hurts to move her neck, and she believes her neck might be swollen. She did not lose consciousness in the accident and denies changes in level of consciousness since that time. She states that she gets a headache every day that lasts approximately 1-2 hours. She occasionally takes 650 mg of over-the-counter Tylenol with relief of the pain. This case study will allow you the opportunity to examine the patient’s optic nerve via use of the ophthalmoscope as well as assess her visual acuity. You will need to document your findings using appropriate medical terminology. Careful assessment of documentation of EACH cranial nerve is integral to performing a comprehensive neurological assessment. Be sure to assess for foot neuropathy using the monofilament test.

Tips and Tricks

By now you are very familiar and comfortable with navigating the Shadow Health virtual learning environment. The simulated patients are similar to actual patients and can respond to over 70,000 initial and follow-up questions. Your patients will never get frustrated when you ask multiple questions and they will never get embarrassed or withhold information if you address sensitive subjects, like sexual activity.

Be sure to practice asking interview questions in Shadow Health using the talk-to-text feature and the Google Chrome browser. This will assist with reducing the time commitment for each assignment and enhance the fidelity of your patient-provider experience.

When writing up your physical examination findings, it is insufficient to simply document that the cranial nerve assessed was “intact” or “normal”. What does this mean? Document exactly what you assessed and the findings. Documentation of pertinent negative findings, which denote what you expect to find during the examination and not an abnormality, are just as important as pertinent positive, or abnormal, findings.

Purposes

The purposes of the Shadow Health Physical Assessment Assignments are to: (a) increase knowledge and understanding of advanced practice physical assessment skills and techniques, (b) conduct focused and comprehensive histories and physical assessments for various patient populations, (c) adapt or modify your physical assessment skills and techniques to suit the individual needs of the patient, (d) apply assessment skills and techniques to gather subjective and objective data, (e) differentiate normal from abnormal physical examination findings, (f) summarize, organize, and appropriately document findings using correct professional terminology, (g) practice developing primary and differential diagnoses, (h) practice creating treatment plans which include diagnostics, medication, education, consultation/referral, and follow-up planning; and (i) analyze and reflect on own performance to gain insight and foster knowledge.

Due Date

Sunday 11:59 PM MT at the end of each respective week.

Students are expected to submit assignments by the time they are due. Assignments submitted after the due date and time will receive a deduction of 10% of the total points possible for that assignment for each day the assignment is late. Assignments will be accepted, with penalty as described, up to a maximum of three days late, after which point a zero will be recorded for the assignment.

In the event of an emergency that prevents timely submission of an assignment, students may petition their instructor for a waiver of the late submission grade reduction. The instructor will review the student’s rationale for the request and make a determination based on the merits of the student’s appeal. Consideration of the student’s total course performance to date will be a contributing factor in the determination. Students should continue to attend class, actively participate, and complete other assignments while the appeal is pending.

Total Points Possible: 75 Points

Assignment

Step One: Complete the designated Shadow Health (SH) Assignment on the SH platform.

Step Two: Document your findings on the Fillable Soap Note Template or the Printable Soap Note.

Step Three: Upload the Lab Pass and completed SOAP Note as separate documents to the same assignment tab in the gradebook.

Requirements

NOTE: Before initiating any activity in Shadow Health, complete the required course weekly readings and lessons as well as review the introduction and pre-brief.

Complete the Shadow Health Concept Lab (Weeks 2, 4, and 5) prior to beginning the graded assignment.
Gather subjective and objective data by completing a focused, detailed health history and physical examination for each physical assessment assignment.
Critically appraise the findings as normal or abnormal.
Complete the post-activity assessment questions for each assignment.
Complete all reflection questions following each physical assessment assignment.
Digital Clinical Experience (DCE) scores do not round up. For example, a DCE score of 92.99 is a 92, not a 93.
You have a maximum of two (2) attempts per Shadow Health assignment to improve your performance. However, you may elect not to repeat any assignment. NOTE: If you repeat an attempt, ONLY the second attempt will be graded, regardless of the DCE score. Please refer to the grading rubric categories for details.
Download the Lab Pass for the final attempt on the assignment.
On the Canvas Platform:

Summarize, organize, and appropriately document findings using correct professional terminology on the SOAP Note Template.
Identify three (3) differential diagnoses and provide ICD-10 codes and pertinent positive and negative findings for each diagnosis.
Create a comprehensive treatment plan for each assignment. Must address the following components: Diagnostics, Medication, Education, Referral/Consultation, and Follow-up planning. If no interventions for one or more components, document “none at this time” but do not skip over the component.
Provide rationales and citations for diagnoses and interventions.
Include at least one scholarly source to support diagnoses and treatment interventions with rationales and references on the SOAP note. Only scholarly sources are acceptable for citation and reference in this course. These include peer-reviewed publications, government reports, or sources written by a professional or scholar in the field. The textbooks and lessons are NOT considered to be outside scholarly sources. For the threaded discussions and reflection posts, reputable internet sources such as websites by government agencies (URL ends in .gov) and respected organizations (often ends in .org) can be counted as scholarly sources. The best outside scholarly source to use is a peer-reviewed nursing journal. You are encouraged to use the Chamberlain library and search one of the available databases for a peer-reviewed journal article. The following sources should not be used: Wikipedia, Wikis, or blogs. These websites are not considered scholarly as anyone can add to these. Please be aware that .com websites can vary in scholarship and quality. For example, the American Heart Association is a .com site with scholarship and quality. Each student is responsible for determining the scholarship and quality of any .com site. Ask your instructor before using any site if you are unsure. Points will be deducted from the rubric if the site does not demonstrate
