Question 1: A 32-year-old male presents with complaints of a scrotal mass; however, the scrotum is so edematous that it is difficult to assess. How would the nurse practitioner (NP) best determine whether the condition is a hernia or a hydrocele?

* Correct Answer: Bowel sounds may be heard over a hernia.
  Explanation: In cases where the scrotum is edematous and a hernia is suspected, auscultation may reveal bowel sounds if bowel loops are present in the scrotal sac, helping to distinguish a hernia from a hydrocele.

Question 2: A male patient presents to the clinic for evaluation of infertility. Subjectively, the patient complains of pain and fullness of the testes and states, "My testicles feel like a bag of worms." On physical examination, the nurse practitioner notes tortuous veins posterior to and above the testes that extend up into the external inguinal ring. Based on the preceding assessment, the nurse practitioner refers the patient to urology with which diagnosis?

* Correct Answer: Varicocele.
  Explanation: A varicocele is characterized by tortuous, dilated veins in the scrotum, often described as feeling like a "bag of worms." It is a common cause of male infertility and warrants referral to a specialist.
