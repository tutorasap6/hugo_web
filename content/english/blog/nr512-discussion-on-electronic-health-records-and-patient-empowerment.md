Discussion on Electronic Health Records and Patient Empowerment

With the adoption of electronic health records (EHR), one of the significant benefits I have observed is the ability for patients and their families to access and manage their health information more effectively. For instance, I have found it invaluable to keep track of my children's medical histories and immunizations, as well as my husband's medical needs, especially given his history of injuries related to farm work. This accessibility has allowed us to make informed decisions and better manage our healthcare.

However, there are also potential downsides to this increased transparency. I recall a situation where a patient became distressed upon discovering that their medical record included notes about non-compliance with medication, narcotic abuse, and the need for monitoring for illicit drug use. The patient felt that this information should have been kept confidential and was concerned about how it might affect their relationship with future healthcare providers.

The ability for patients to view and potentially correct their health information introduces a new layer of complexity. While it is important for patients to be informed and engaged in their healthcare, there is a risk that allowing them to alter their records could compromise the accuracy of critical health information. In situations where a patient's history of drug abuse or a condition like HIV is involved, the integrity of their medical record is essential for ensuring the safety of both the patient and the healthcare providers involved in their care (Teixeira, Gordon, Camhi, & Bakken, 2011).

It is imperative that we strike a balance between empowering patients and maintaining the accuracy and reliability of their health records. Patients should be encouraged to discuss any concerns with their healthcare providers and seek clarification or addendums to their records when necessary, rather than altering the records themselves. This approach will help safeguard the quality of care while also respecting patient autonomy.
