### What is Data?

Answer: Data refers to raw, unprocessed facts, figures, and details collected through various means. In the context of healthcare, data can include patient information such as vital signs, lab results, and medical histories. These raw data points are the building blocks for generating meaningful information and insights when processed and analyzed.

### What is Knowledge?

Answer: Knowledge is the synthesis of information to create meaning and understanding. It is derived from information processed by analysis, experience, and learning. In healthcare, knowledge can guide clinical practice and decision-making to improve patient outcomes.

Reference: McGonigle, D., & Mastrian, K. G. (2017). Nursing informatics and the foundation of knowledge. Jones & Bartlett Learning.

### What is Firewall?

Answer: A firewall is a network security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It establishes a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks, such as the internet, to protect sensitive information.

### What is Electronic Health Record (EHR)?

Answer: An Electronic Health Record (EHR) is a digital record of a patient's health information, encompassing their medical history, diagnoses, medications, treatment plans, immunization dates, allergies, radiology images, and laboratory test results. EHRs are designed to be shared across different healthcare settings.

### What is National Health Information Infrastructure (NHII)?

Answer: The National Health Information Infrastructure (NHII) is a comprehensive, interconnected system of health information technology designed to improve the quality, safety, and efficiency of healthcare delivery in the United States. It aims to facilitate the exchange of health information among healthcare providers, patients, and other stakeholders.
