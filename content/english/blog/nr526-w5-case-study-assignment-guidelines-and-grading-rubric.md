### Advanced Pathophysiology, Health Assessment, and Pharmacology for Nurse Educators Case Study Assignment Guidelines & Scoring Rubric

Purpose
The purpose of the Case Study assignment is to help students apply and integrate pathophysiology, pharmacology, and health (physical) assessment into simulations of nursing care. Note that case studies such as this can be used as a class discussion and as a case study for various forms of simulation.

Course Outcomes
Through this assignment, the student will demonstrate the ability to:

* CO 2: Utilize critical inquiry and judgment to evaluate the design, implementation, and outcomes of strategies developed for health promotion, health protection, disease prevention, and disease management across diverse healthcare delivery settings. (PO 4, 9)
* CO 5: Analyze risk factors associated with complex disease states in individuals, aggregates, and populations to devise effective disease management and/or health promotion strategies that reflect pertinent psychosocial, cultural, legal, ethical, and safety considerations. (PO 4, 6)
* CO 6: Explicate the environmental factors that impinge upon specific physiologic, psychological, and psychosocial states along the health-illness continuum. (PO 1, 4)
* CO 8: Determine clinical data essential to identifying specified pathophysiologic or psychologic problems and the best plan of care. (PO 1, 4)

Due Date:
Sunday 11:59 p.m. MT at the end of Week 5

Total Points Possible:
250

### REQUIREMENTS

Students will develop a case study that represents a complex health problem of their choice and that could be used in a high-fidelity simulation lab. Your topic should have been approved by your instructor in Week 2.

Provide details in your case study related to the:

1. Modifiable and unmodifiable risk factors represented in your patient
2. Presenting signs and symptoms the patient displays
3. Psychosocial factors
4. Prescribed pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions
5. Laboratory and other diagnostic tests

The case study should start with objectives for the simulation, stated as what the student will do or display and by when (see below). Thereafter, the patient should be presented, along with three questions you will ask your students about the case.

### PREPARING THE CASE STUDY

1. Identify a complex health problem that could be used in a high-fidelity simulation lab to teach undergraduate nursing students good clinical reasoning and critical thinking skills. Your topic should have been approved by your instructor in Week 4.
2. Use the NR526 Case Study Template to develop your assignment.
