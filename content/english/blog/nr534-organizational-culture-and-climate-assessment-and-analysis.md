### Organizational Culture and Climate: Assessment and Analysis

This paper examines the organizational culture and climate of the Kaiser Permanente Hilo facility. It includes an analysis of how the organization’s mission, vision, and goals influence its culture and climate, as well as an identification of the organization's strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, the paper explores the facility’s environment and its ability to support a safe and healthy working environment for both staff and patients, considering the role that leadership style plays in achieving this alignment.

### Organizational Culture Description

Organizational culture refers to the manner in which an organization conducts its operations, driven by its mission, vision, and goals. This culture guides the decision-making processes used by leadership and shapes the overall climate of the organization. Organizational climate, on the other hand, is the perception employees have of their work environment and its impact on their physical and emotional well-being (Iljins, Skvarciany, & Gaile-Sarkane, 2015).

While organizational culture and climate are related, they differ in focus. Culture pertains to the values and beliefs upheld by the organization, which are reflected in its operations and decision-making. Climate, however, refers to how employees perceive their experiences and interactions within the organization. The culture of an organization has been linked to its longevity and effectiveness, influencing employee productivity, morale, engagement, satisfaction, and overall well-being—both physically and mentally.

Assessing organizational culture to determine its style and workplace outcomes is crucial for evaluating how well the organization's mission, vision, and goals are aligned with its operational realities (Fisher).
