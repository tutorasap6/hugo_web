Self-Assessment of NLN Core Competencies for Nurse Educators Worksheet

You are to reflect upon and complete a self-assessment at the beginning of Week 1 and submit it by 11:59 p.m. MT Sunday of Week 1. You are to identify your level of competency for each of the sub-competencies listed on the worksheet (see example). In the next column, you will see the course outcomes, which are aligned with the NLN Nurse Educator Core Competencies. The Course Outcomes are not specific to the individual sub-competencies; however, by meeting the course outcomes, you will be able to increase your knowledge, skills, and abilities in the Core Competency identified for this course.

In the final column for Week One, identify a specific example of what you will do throughout this course to achieve each course outcome (possible points = 50). In Week 8, you will again identify your level of competency for each of the sub-competencies listed on the Week One Worksheet. In the final column, you will give a specific example that shows how you demonstrated each course outcome. The assignment is to be submitted for grading.
