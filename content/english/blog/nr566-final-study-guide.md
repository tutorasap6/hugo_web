    * Nasal gel, transdermal patch, transdermal gel, topical solution, buccal tablet, and implantable subcutaneous pellets.
    * Testosterone cypionate: Requires an office visit every 2-4 weeks. Blood levels fluctuate widely.
    * Testosterone enanthate: Requires an office visit every 2-4 weeks. Blood levels fluctuate widely.
    * Testosterone transdermal: Rash at patch site is common.
    * Testosterone gel: It may be difficult to attain adequate levels. Easier to use and better tolerated than testosterone patches. Can transfer to others via intimate contact.
