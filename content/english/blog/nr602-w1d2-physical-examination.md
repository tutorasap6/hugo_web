Summary:The physical examination of the patient, Jo, reveals that she is generally healthy and well-developed for her age, with normal findings in her HEENT, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and musculoskeletal systems. The primary concern noted is a mild visual impairment as indicated by the Snellen exam, which may require further evaluation and possible referral to an optometrist. The rest of the examination findings are within normal limits, and there are no acute concerns noted.
