iHuman Reflection Week 7

In this week’s iHuman case scenario, the patient presented with chronic lower abdominal pain, necessitating a thorough diagnostic approach to rule out various potential causes. To achieve a comprehensive assessment, I initially considered ordering a complete blood count (CBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free T4, and an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan. These tests are essential for identifying systemic infections, inflammatory diseases, thyroid dysfunction, and potential structural abnormalities within the abdomen.

However, after evaluating the financial implications of these diagnostic tests, particularly for an uninsured patient, I realized the need to balance clinical judgment with cost-effectiveness. According to MDsave, a platform that provides national average costs for diagnostic procedures, the total cost for the tests I initially considered would be approximately $1,096 (MDsave, n.d.). Such an expense could be prohibitive for a patient without insurance, potentially leading to non-compliance with recommended care.

Given these financial considerations, I decided to narrow down the diagnostic approach. I would prioritize ordering the CBC and CRP tests, which are relatively low-cost, at around $64 for both (MDsave, n.d.). These tests are crucial for determining the presence of infection or inflammation, which could guide further diagnostic and therapeutic decisions.

This reflection highlights the importance of integrating cost discussions into patient care, especially for those who are uninsured or underinsured. As a healthcare provider, it is essential to consider a patient’s financial situation when planning diagnostic tests and treatments. Failing to do so may result in patients not following through with the recommended care, thereby exacerbating their health conditions. Studies have shown that individuals living in poverty are more likely to experience chronic diseases and disabilities, further emphasizing the need for affordable healthcare options (Parry et al., 2021).
