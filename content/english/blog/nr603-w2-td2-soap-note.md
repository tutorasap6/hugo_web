Assessment (A):

Primary Diagnosis:

* Occupational Asthma
  Rationale: The patient’s SOB is related to her work environment, specifically in a bakery where she is exposed to flour dust and other potential allergens. Her symptoms subside when she is away from work, which is characteristic of occupational asthma.

Secondary Diagnosis:

* Allergic Rhinitis
  Rationale: The patient has a history of seasonal allergies, which may contribute to her respiratory symptoms, especially in an environment with potential allergens like flour.

Differential Diagnoses:

* Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): Considered due to her family history of COPD and lung cancer, though her personal smoking history is minimal.
* Vocal Cord Dysfunction (VCD): Could mimic asthma-like symptoms, particularly in response to environmental triggers.
* Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): While the patient denies heartburn, GERD can sometimes present with respiratory symptoms without typical gastrointestinal complaints.

***

Plan (P):

1. Diagnostic Tests:
   * Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs): To assess for reversible airway obstruction.
   * Allergy Testing: Consider referral for repeat allergy testing to identify specific workplace triggers.
   * Chest X-ray: To rule out any underlying pulmonary conditions, given her family history.
2. Medications:
   * Short-Acting Beta Agonist (SABA): Prescribe albuterol inhaler for use as needed for SOB at work.
   * Inhaled Corticosteroid (ICS): Consider initiation depending on PFT results and symptom control.
3. Patient Education:
   * Educate the patient on occupational asthma and the importance of minimizing exposure to potential triggers at work.
   * Discuss the need for regular monitoring of symptoms and follow-up care.
   * Advise on the potential need for workplace accommodations or changes if symptoms persist.
4. Follow-Up:
   * Schedule follow-up appointment in 1-2 weeks to review PFT results and assess the effectiveness of the treatment plan.
5. Referrals:
   * Pulmonologist: Referral for further evaluation and management if PFTs indicate significant obstruction or if symptoms do not improve with initial treatment.
