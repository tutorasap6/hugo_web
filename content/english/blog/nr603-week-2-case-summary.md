#### Subjective (S):

* Chief Complaint (CC):
  "I think I may have a cold. I've been having a hard time breathing on and off lately."
* History of Present Illness (HPI):
  M.G. is a 40-year-old female who reports experiencing intermittent shortness of breath (SOB), primarily while at work. She notes that her symptoms tend to subside by the time she gets home. She has not experienced SOB during weekends, but symptoms reappear a few hours after returning to work on weekdays. A few months ago, she had a similar episode at work that was severe enough to prompt her to leave work and seek care at an urgent care clinic. There, she received a breathing treatment (exact type unspecified) and was prescribed an antibiotic, which she completed. She is currently requesting another course of antibiotics as she believes her symptoms might be returning. She explicitly denies any sputum production, has not noticed any new allergy triggers, and does not experience heartburn. She does mention that her shortness of breath is generally worse during the spring season, correlating with her known seasonal allergies.

  * Multivitamin: Taken daily.
