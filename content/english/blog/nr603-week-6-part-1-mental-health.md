History of Present Illness (HPI):
JA is a 31-year-old Hispanic female who presents with feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and recent weight gain.

JA was previously active in social groups, including an intramural soccer league, but has since withdrawn from all activities except for work. She has been written up at work multiple times for tardiness and major mistakes due to lack of concentration, leading to a loss of clients. JA has been coming home from work with fast food daily and rarely leaves her room except to use the restroom. She cries almost every day and has gained 15 lbs over the last few weeks. JA reports feeling tired all the time despite sleeping more than usual. She expresses feelings of worthlessness and guilt, believing the breakup was her fault for not meeting her fiancé's needs and missing signs of his infidelity.
