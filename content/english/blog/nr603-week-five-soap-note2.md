Assessment:

1. Suspicious Mole/Neoplasm of Uncertain Behavior (D48.5):
   * The mole’s characteristics—8mm in size, irregular border, and dark coloration—are concerning for potential melanoma. Given the patient's fair skin and family history of melanoma, further evaluation is warranted.
2. Mild Hypertension (I10):
   * BP 130/67 indicates borderline/mild hypertension. Although currently not treated, it’s important to monitor and manage through lifestyle modifications due to family history.
3. Possible Cognitive Changes (R41.3):
   * Although the patient denies cognitive difficulties, the sister’s report of recent changes warrants a closer assessment, possibly including neuropsychological testing.

***

Plan:

1. Mole Evaluation:
   * Referral to Dermatology: Immediate referral for biopsy to rule out melanoma.
   * Patient Education: Advise the patient on the ABCDEs (Asymmetry, Border, Color, Diameter, Evolving) of melanoma and the importance of regular skin checks.
   * Follow-Up: Schedule a follow-up visit in 1 week to discuss biopsy results and further management.
2. Hypertension Management:
   * Lifestyle Modifications: Encourage regular exercise, a low-sodium diet, weight management, and stress reduction techniques.
   * Monitoring: Recheck blood pressure at the next visit.
   * Patient Education: Discuss the importance of controlling blood pressure to prevent cardiovascular complications.
3. Cognitive Function:
   * Further Assessment: Consider neuropsychological testing or Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) at the next visit if cognitive changes persist or worsen.
   * Patient and Family Education: Discuss the early signs of cognitive impairment and the importance of monitoring changes in memory and function.
4. Health Maintenance:
   * Vaccinations: Strongly recommend an annual flu vaccine, given the patient’s overall health status.
   * Patient Education: Discuss the benefits of vaccination, especially for preventing complications from flu-related illnesses.
