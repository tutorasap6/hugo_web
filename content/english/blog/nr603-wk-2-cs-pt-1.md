### Severe Persistent Asthma Secondary to Occupational Exposure: A Case Study Analysis

#### Primary Diagnosis: Severe Persistent Asthma (J45.50) Secondary to Occupational Exposure to Allergens (J45.909)

Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways, leading to episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing. When left untreated or poorly managed, asthma can severely impact the quality of life and may lead to fatal complications. In this case study, the primary diagnosis is severe persistent asthma, compounded by occupational exposure to allergens. The patient’s condition and its contributing factors are analyzed based on clinical findings, diagnostic results, and relevant literature.

#### Presentation and Risk Factors

The patient presents with a diagnosis of severe persistent asthma, primarily influenced by occupational exposure. Several clinical indicators support this diagnosis. Notably, the patient's symptoms manifest exclusively at work, never during weekends or at home. This observation strongly suggests a workplace-related trigger, consistent with occupational asthma. The absence of symptoms during non-working hours further emphasizes the role of environmental factors specific to the workplace in exacerbating the patient's condition.

Additionally, the patient's history reveals no signs or symptoms of an acute infection. There is no fever, sputum production, or sinus tenderness, which could otherwise indicate an infectious etiology. The patient's nares are patent, but a thin, white exudate and boggy, pale mucosa are observed, along with a deviated nasal septum. These findings, coupled with a slight inspiratory and forced expiratory wheeze that does not clear with coughing, suggest chronic airway inflammation typical of asthma.

A key diagnostic criterion for asthma, particularly occupational asthma, is the improvement in lung function following bronchodilator administration. In this case, the patient’s pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio was 60%, which improved to 75% post-bronchodilation. This significant improvement indicates a reversible obstructive process, further supporting the diagnosis of asthma (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 2007). The reversibility of airway obstruction is a hallmark of asthma and distinguishes it from other chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases.

#### Occupational Exposure and Asthma

Occupational asthma is a prevalent condition, accounting for a significant proportion of adult-onset asthma cases. According to Ilmarinen, Tuomisto, and Kankaanranta (2015), occupational exposure is responsible for 10-25% of adult-onset asthma cases. This patient's work environment, a bakery, presents specific risks. The literature identifies flour as a common allergen responsible for occupational asthma in bakers, with 50-90% of cases linked to this exposure (Dao & Bernstein, 2018). Flour dust, along with other substances like dilisocyanate, latex, and enzyme allergens, can trigger asthma symptoms in susceptible individuals. The high mortality rate observed among U.S. bakers due to asthma-like symptoms underscores the severity of this occupational hazard.

The patient’s recent employment in a bakery, coupled with the timing of symptom onset, strongly suggests that flour or other bakery-related allergens are the likely triggers of her asthma. This is concerning, especially considering the patient's history of seasonal allergic rhinitis and childhood eczema, both of which are risk factors for developing asthma. Furthermore, her previous smoking history—although limited to a pack per week for three years during her twenties—adds to her susceptibility to asthma, as smoking is known to exacerbate airway inflammation and increase the risk of asthma in adults (Ilmarinen, Tuomisto, & Kankaanranta, 2015).

#### Diagnostic Findings

The diagnosis of severe persistent asthma, exacerbated by occupational exposure, is supported by both clinical symptoms and diagnostic tests. The patient’s chest X-ray (CXR) from the previous year was clear, leading to a bronchitis diagnosis based solely on symptoms at that time. However, the current presentation, coupled with pulmonary function tests (PFTs), provides a clearer picture. The patient’s significant improvement in FEV1/FVC post-bronchodilator use confirms the diagnosis of asthma, as reversible airway obstruction is characteristic of this condition.

#### Management and Treatment

Managing severe persistent asthma, particularly when complicated by occupational exposure, requires a multifaceted approach. The primary goal is to control symptoms and prevent exacerbations by minimizing exposure to triggers and optimizing pharmacological therapy. In this case, the patient’s occupational environment is a significant factor, and addressing this exposure is crucial.

Current guidelines recommend the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as the mainstay of treatment for persistent asthma, combined with long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs) for symptom control (Global Initiative for Asthma, 2021). For this patient, whose symptoms are exacerbated by workplace allergens, it may be necessary to implement additional strategies such as the use of high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters in the workplace or the consideration of alternative employment if symptom control is not achievable within her current occupational setting.

The patient is currently taking Zyrtec, an antihistamine that may provide some relief from allergic symptoms but is insufficient as monotherapy for asthma. A comprehensive asthma action plan, including the use of ICS/LABA combinations, leukotriene receptor antagonists, and possibly omalizumab for patients with allergic asthma, should be considered. Regular follow-up and monitoring of lung function through PFTs are essential to ensure adequate control of the condition.

#### Conclusion

Severe persistent asthma, particularly when influenced by occupational exposure, presents a significant challenge in both diagnosis and management. This case highlights the importance of a thorough clinical evaluation, including detailed patient history, physical examination, and appropriate diagnostic testing. The patient’s occupational environment, history of allergic rhinitis, childhood eczema, and smoking history are critical factors contributing to her current condition. Effective management requires a combination of pharmacological treatment and strategies to minimize exposure to workplace allergens. By addressing these factors, healthcare providers can help reduce the burden of asthma on the patient’s quality of life.
