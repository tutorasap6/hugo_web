***

Assessment (A):

* Primary Diagnosis:
  Non-ST Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI)
  ICD-10: I21.4
  Rationale: Sean presents with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and recent chest pain associated with symptoms indicative of myocardial ischemia (shortness of breath, nausea, sweating). The in-office EKG showing ST depression further supports this diagnosis. The cessation of antihypertensive medication and elevated cholesterol levels increase his risk of coronary artery disease and subsequent myocardial infarction.
* Secondary Diagnosis:
  Dyslipidemia
  ICD-10: E78.5
  Rationale: Sean's lab results indicate elevated total cholesterol, high LDL, and low HDL levels. Despite lifestyle management, these values suggest that diet and exercise alone may not be sufficient for controlling his dyslipidemia, which likely contributed to his NSTEMI.
* Differential Diagnosis:
  * Peptic Ulcer Disease (PUD), Acute Without Hemorrhage or Perforation
    ICD-10: K27.3
    Rationale: PUD can present with epigastric pain that may be mistaken for non-cardiac chest pain. Sean's symptoms of nausea and chest discomfort could be suggestive of PUD, but the lack of typical GI symptoms (e.g., heartburn, indigestion) and the presence of cardiac risk factors makes this less likely.

***

Plan (P):

* Immediate Action:
  * Send Sean to the nearest emergency department (ED) for further evaluation and management, given the high risk of a major cardiac event.
  * Inform the ED about Sean's condition, including his recent NSTEMI symptoms and EKG findings.
* Diagnostics:
  * In the ED: Expect further diagnostics such as a full lipid panel, HbA1c (if not done recently), routine chemistries, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and cardiac enzyme levels (CKMB, Troponin). A chest X-ray may be ordered to assess for cardiomegaly, pericardial effusion, or acute pulmonary edema.
* Medications:
  * In the ED: Sean may receive aspirin (325 mg stat, then 75 mg daily), clopidogrel (600 mg now, then 150 mg daily x 7 days and 75 mg daily), and carvedilol (25 mg PO BID). Nitroglycerin sublingual (0.3 mg q5min for chest pain) and simvastatin (40 mg PO daily) may be initiated, along with lisinopril (10 mg PO daily) for hypertension management.
* Referrals:
  * Referral to a cardiologist for further evaluation, including a possible stress test, echocardiogram, and other cardiac assessments.
* Patient Education:
  * Educate Sean on the severity of his condition and the importance of immediate medical attention if similar symptoms occur in the future.
  * Discuss the need for strict adherence to prescribed medications, lifestyle modifications, and regular follow-up with his healthcare provider.
  * Recommend smoking cessation, a low-cholesterol diet, regular physical activity, and maintaining an ideal BMI.
  * Introduce Sean to the DASH diet and emphasize the importance of managing his blood pressure through regular monitoring and medication compliance.
* Follow-Up:
  * After discharge from the hospital, Sean should return to the clinic for a follow-up visit. At that time, we will review his care plan, evaluate medication compliance, and assess for any further cardiac risk factors or complications.
