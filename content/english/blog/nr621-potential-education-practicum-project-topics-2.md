### NR621 Potential Education Practicum Project Topics

***

#### Directions

1. Start Here: Identify the educational issue you want to explore.
2. Decide: Determine how you want to approach the issue.
3. Consider: Reflect on the possible outcomes of your project.

#### Category: Student/Learning Issues

Educational Issues:

* Application of Learning in Clinical Settings:
  * Students arenâ€™t applying what they learn in didactic instruction when they go to clinicals.
  * Students are not demonstrating critical thinking in clinical experiences.
  * High incident report rates among students.
* Simulation and Concept Mapping:
  * High-fidelity simulation.
  * Relationship of fun to learning.
  * Application of the NLN/Jeffries Simulation Theory.
  * Simulation on a low budget.
  * Using simulation to prepare students for clinical experiences.
  * Incorporating critical thinking into clinical-lab simulations (beyond just procedures!).
  * Concept mapping vs. nursing care plans.
* Instructional Methods:
  * Research-related lecturing and the use of PowerPoints.
  * Creative methods to teach students critical thinking using clinical topics:
    * Problem-based learning.
    * Using case studies.
    * Group learning.
    * "Team-based learning" by Michaelsen.
    * Virtual world scenarios.
  * Use of social media in teaching.
* Assessment and Grading:
  * Poor performance on teacher-developed exams and standardized exams (e.g., ATI, HESI).
  * Inadequate methods for determining clinical failure.
  * Students objecting to their grades in clinicals.
  * Students disputing letter grades for clinicals.
  * Best practices in assigning clinical grades in nursing.
  * Determining whether students have met learning outcomes in clinical experiences.

Potential Project Topics and Approaches:

* Improving Application of Learning:
  * Utilize high-fidelity simulation or concept mapping to enhance clinical preparation.
  * Develop strategies to integrate critical thinking into clinical-lab simulations.
* Innovative Teaching Methods:
  * Explore creative teaching methods such as problem-based learning, case studies, or team-based learning.
  * Investigate the impact of virtual world scenarios or social media on student learning.
* Assessment Strategies:
  * Analyze the effectiveness of concept maps versus traditional nursing care plans.
  * Develop best practices for assigning and evaluating clinical grades.

***

Possible Outcomes:

* Assessment Metrics:
  * Improved clinical grades and critical thinking surveys.
  * Reduced incident reports and improved care plan grades.
  * Enhanced scores on teacher-made and standardized exams (e.g., ATI, HESI).
  * Increased student satisfaction and fewer disputes over grades.
* Project Evaluation:
  * Use of debriefing conclusions and taped lab simulations to assess effectiveness.
  * Evaluation of unit and final grades, assignment grades, and clinical performance metrics.
