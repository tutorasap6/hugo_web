### Professional Identity

A professional identity helps us as nurses build our confidence in becoming bachelor's degree-holding nurses. Your identity as a nurse defines what kind of nurse you are. This philosophy will help me grow and understand my strengths and weaknesses as a nurse and help me better understand what I can improve on in my career. I will discuss my reason for joining the nursing profession, my philosophy on nursing, my strengths and weaknesses of being a nurse, and my transition to a baccalaureate role.

### The Reason I Chose Nursing

I became a nurse because of my love for caring for others in their worst moments. If you had asked me when I was a kid what I wanted to do for my career, I would have said I wanted to become a firefighter. I quickly realized that becoming a firefighter was not for me, but I wanted to do something to help others. I learned about a volunteer program at Lawnwood Hospital over the summer and thought it would be an excellent opportunity to learn about working in a hospital. During that summer, I quickly realized I wanted to become a nurse. Seeing how nurses interact with their patients and make them smile and feel better at their patients' lowest moments pushed me toward nursing. What made me lean towards cardiac nursing was my grandpa. In 2012, he had quadruple heart bypass surgery, and the surgeon and nurses who took care of him were all amazing. Today I am working on the cardiac stepdown unit that my grandpa was in after his surgery. My love for nursing is growing daily, and I love seeing the smiles on my patients' faces when caring for them.

My journey into nursing was also influenced by the profound impact that healthcare professionals had on my family. My grandfatherâ€™s battle with heart disease and his subsequent quadruple bypass surgery in 2012 left a lasting impression on me. The dedication, skill, and compassion demonstrated by his healthcare team inspired me to pursue a career where I could make a similar difference in people's lives. Today, I am privileged to work on the same cardiac stepdown unit where my grandfather was treated, and it is deeply fulfilling to contribute to the recovery and well-being of my patients.

In addition to my personal experiences, the diverse opportunities within the nursing profession further solidified my decision. Nursing is a dynamic field with a wide range of specialties and career paths. From critical care and emergency nursing to community health and education, the possibilities are vast and varied. This diversity ensures that there is always room for growth and advancement, allowing nurses to continually develop their skills and explore new areas of interest.

### Philosophy for Nursing

My philosophy for nursing is to provide excellent service to my community and advocate for those who cannot speak for themselves. I was raised in a household where we tried to help those in need whenever possible. This upbringing instilled in me the importance of compassion, empathy, and service. As a nurse, I strive to embody these values in my daily practice. I believe that every patient deserves high-quality care, respect, and dignity, regardless of their background or circumstances. My goal is to be a nurse who not only treats illnesses but also supports patients emotionally and mentally.

The core of my nursing philosophy is centered on holistic care. Holistic nursing is a practice that focuses on treating the whole person rather than just the symptoms of a disease. It encompasses physical, emotional, social, and spiritual dimensions of care, recognizing that each aspect of a person's life can influence their health and well-being. This approach is grounded in the belief that health is more than the absence of illness; it is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being.

To provide holistic care, I emphasize the importance of building strong, trusting relationships with my patients. Effective communication is key to understanding their needs, preferences, and concerns. By actively listening and showing empathy, I can create a supportive environment where patients feel valued and understood. This not only enhances their overall experience but also promotes better health outcomes.

Advocacy is another fundamental aspect of my nursing philosophy. Nurses have a responsibility to advocate for their patients' rights and needs, especially those who are vulnerable or marginalized. This involves speaking up for patients, ensuring they receive appropriate care, and helping them navigate the complexities of the healthcare system. Advocacy also extends to promoting health equity and addressing social determinants of health that can impact patients' well-being.

### Strengths and Weaknesses of Being a Nurse

Understanding my strengths and weaknesses is crucial for my professional growth. One of my strengths is my ability to connect with patients and provide empathetic care. I find it easy to build rapport with patients and their families, which helps create a supportive and trusting environment. Additionally, I have strong organizational skills and attention to detail, which are essential in managing patient care effectively.

I believe that my ability to remain calm and composed under pressure is another significant strength. Nursing can be a high-stress profession, particularly in critical care settings where quick decision-making and effective action are vital. My capacity to stay focused and maintain a clear mind in these situations enables me to provide high-quality care even in the most challenging circumstances.

Collaboration is also one of my strong suits. Nursing is inherently a team-oriented profession, and effective collaboration with colleagues is essential for delivering comprehensive care. I value the diverse perspectives and expertise that my colleagues bring, and I strive to foster a collaborative environment where everyone feels supported and respected.

However, I also recognize my weaknesses. I sometimes struggle with delegating tasks, as I tend to take on too much responsibility myself. This can lead to burnout and decreased efficiency. Additionally, I am working on improving my clinical skills and staying updated with the latest advancements in nursing practice. By acknowledging these weaknesses, I can take proactive steps to address them and become a more well-rounded nurse.

One of my areas for improvement is time management. While I am generally organized, I sometimes find it challenging to balance multiple tasks and responsibilities simultaneously. This can lead to stress and a sense of being overwhelmed. To address this, I am actively seeking strategies to enhance my time management skills, such as prioritizing tasks, setting realistic goals, and using tools like planners and schedules.

Another area where I am seeking growth is in my leadership skills. As I transition into a baccalaureate role, I recognize the importance of developing strong leadership abilities. Effective leaders inspire and motivate their teams, foster a positive work environment, and drive improvements in patient care. To build my leadership skills, I am pursuing additional training and seeking mentorship from experienced nurse leaders.

### Transition to a Baccalaureate Role

Transitioning to a baccalaureate role involves adapting to new responsibilities and expectations. This transition is essential for advancing my career and providing higher-quality care. As I pursue my baccalaureate degree, I am focusing on enhancing my leadership skills, critical thinking abilities, and evidence-based practice. These competencies are crucial for making informed decisions, leading healthcare teams, and improving patient outcomes.

To support this transition, I am actively seeking mentorship from experienced nurses and engaging in professional development opportunities. I am also committed to lifelong learning and staying current with nursing research and best practices. By doing so, I can continuously improve my skills and knowledge, ultimately becoming a more effective and confident nurse.

One of the key benefits of obtaining a baccalaureate degree is the expanded scope of practice it offers. Baccalaureate-prepared nurses are equipped with a broader knowledge base and a deeper understanding of the complexities of healthcare. This enables them to take on more advanced roles, such as leadership positions, clinical nurse specialists, and nurse educators. These roles not only contribute to personal and professional growth but also enhance the overall quality of patient care.

Furthermore, baccalaureate education emphasizes the importance of evidence-based practice. Evidence-based practice involves integrating the best available research evidence with clinical expertise and patient preferences to make informed decisions about patient care. This approach ensures that nursing practice is grounded in the most current and reliable evidence, leading to better patient outcomes. By developing my skills in evidence-based practice, I can contribute to advancing the nursing profession and improving healthcare delivery.

Another critical aspect of transitioning to a baccalaureate role is the development of advanced critical thinking skills. Critical thinking is essential for effective problem-solving and decision-making in nursing. It involves analyzing complex situations, evaluating evidence, and considering multiple perspectives to arrive at the best possible solution. Through my baccalaureate education, I am honing my critical thinking abilities, which will enable me to navigate the complexities of patient care and contribute to innovative solutions in healthcare.

### My Short-Term Goal

The short-term goals I have set for myself are to finish my BSN degree by the end of this year, take the Critical Care Registered Nurse (CCRN) certification exam, and start working in the cardiac ICU unit. I expect to graduate with my BSN degree by the end of the year. I am determined to finish my BSN degree this year because I want to take the CCRN examination as soon as possible. My BSN degree and CCRN certification will help me apply for the cardiac ICU at my facility. Most nurses who work in that unit have their bachelor's degrees and are either already critical care certified or taking the exam soon.

### My Long-Term Goal

My long-term goal is to become a certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA) and work with the cardiothoracic surgery team at my current hospital. The reason why I want to become a CRNA is that I love critical thinking, and I love being in the operating room. I had the opportunity to watch a heart bypass surgery a few months ago, and the CRNA on the case was very friendly. He taught me a lot about the different medications the patient was on, and that encouraged me to want to become a CRNA. I will need at least 1-2 years of ICU experience before applying to CRNA school. Then, I will need to maintain a 3.0 GPA and complete the 2-3 year CRNA program. My mentor can help me achieve this goal because she also wants to become a CRNA. My mentor can encourage me to continue receiving the education needed and help me follow through to make sure all these goals are achieved.

### Differences Between ADN Program and BSN Program

A big difference between the ADN program and the BSN program is that the ADN program is in person at a campus, whereas the BSN program is all online. It has been a learning curve for me to go from being able to interact and be hands-on while learning in the ADN program to having to read and teach myself all the info in the BSN program. Another difference between these two programs is that in the ADN program you have clinicals at the hospital. In the BSN program, there are no clinicals. I enjoyed going to the hospital while in nursing school because it helped me better understand the concepts I was learning in the classes and put it all together in the medical environment. One concept of the BSN program I like is that we can complete our coursework at our own pace. The work for that week must be finished by the due date. The ADN program has multiple weekly assignments due each day on top of skills labs (Buxton, 2023).

### Conclusion

The reason I became a nurse is because I love helping people and making people feel better in their lowest moments. My philosophy for nursing is to provide excellent service to my patients and to advocate for those who cannot advocate for themselves. To achieve my goals in my nursing career, I will need to finish my BSN degree. This degree will let me continue on with the short-term goal of taking the CCRN certification exam and my long-term goal of becoming a CRNA.
