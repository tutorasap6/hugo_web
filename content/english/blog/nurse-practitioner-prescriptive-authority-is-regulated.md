Nurse practitioner prescriptive authority is regulated by:

Question 33 options:

 

The National Council of State Boards of Nursing

 

The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration

 

The State Board of Nursing for each state

 

The State Board of Pharmacy

### Answer

The nurse practitioner prescriptive authority is regulated by:

The State Board of Nursing for each state

### Explanation

While all the entities listed in the options play a role in the regulation of nurse practitioners and their prescriptive authority, the primary regulatory body is the State Board of Nursing for each state.

The State Board of Nursing is responsible for setting the scope of practice for nurse practitioners within their jurisdiction, which includes the authority to prescribe medications. The rules and regulations can vary from state to state.

The National Council of State Boards of Nursing provides guidance and sets standards, but the actual regulation is done at the state level.

The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) does regulate the prescription of controlled substances, and nurse practitioners must have a DEA number to prescribe these medications. However, the DEA does not regulate the overall prescriptive authority of nurse practitioners.

The State Board of Pharmacy may also have a role in regulating prescription practices, but again, the primary authority lies with the State Board of Nursing.

### Roles of Various Entities:

* The National Council of State Boards of Nursing: Provides guidance and sets standards.
* The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration: Regulates the prescription of controlled substances.
* The State Board of Nursing for each state: Regulates the scope of practice for nurse practitioners, including prescriptive authority.
* The State Board of Pharmacy: May regulate prescription practices, but the primary authority lies with the State Board of Nursing.

### Reference

According to Phillips (2021), the regulation of nurse practitioners' prescriptive authority is primarily overseen by the State Boards of Nursing. These boards are responsible for defining the scope of practice for nurse practitioners within their respective states, including the authorization to prescribe medications. The variability in regulations from state to state underscores the importance of understanding local legislative frameworks for nurse practitioners.
