### NR228 Nutrition, Health, & Wellness: Study Guide for Exam 1

This study guide has been developed to help you prepare for the first exam in NR228 Nutrition, Health, & Wellness. Below is a summary of key concepts from Chapters 1 and 2 that will be covered in the exam.

***

#### Chapter 1: Wellness Nutrition

1\. Health Promotion through Patient Education:

* Purpose: The main purpose of health promotion through patient education is to increase the level of health in individuals, families, groups, and communities. It involves educating patients on how to maintain and improve their health, prevent disease, and manage chronic conditions.

2\. Healthy People 2020 (HP2020):

* Purpose: HP2020 aims to increase awareness and understanding of health, provide measurable objectives, identify critical research needs, and evaluate and address data needs. It serves as a framework for improving the health of all Americans.
* Overarching Goals: The overarching goals of HP2020 include achieving health equity, eliminating disparities, and improving the health of all population groups, creating social and physical environments that promote good health for all, and promoting quality of life, healthy development, and healthy behaviors across all life stages.

3\. Nutrient Categories:

* Examples: Carbohydrates, proteins, lipids (fats), vitamins, minerals, and water are the six nutrient categories essential for human health.
* Energy Values for Each Nutrient:
  * Carbohydrates: 4 kcal/gram
  * Proteins: 4 kcal/gram
  * Fats: 9 kcal/gram
  * Alcohol: 7 kcal/gram
* These energy values are used to calculate the total caloric content (Kcal) of foods and meals.

4\. Essential vs. Non-Essential Nutrients:

* Essential Nutrients: These are nutrients that the body cannot synthesize and must be obtained from the diet. They provide energy, regulate body processes, and aid in growth and repair.
* Non-Essential Nutrients: These are nutrients that the body can produce on its own, so they do not need to be obtained through the diet.

#### Chapter 2: Personal and Community Nutrition

1\. Food Selection Terms:

* Food Preferences: Refers to the foods we choose to eat when all options are available in the same time and quantity. These are influenced by taste, cultural background, and personal experiences.
* Food Choice: Refers to the specific foods that we select when we are ready to eat. These choices are often influenced by convenience, availability, and current circumstances.

2\. Tools for Nutrition and Meal Planning:

* Dietary Guidelines for Americans: Provides recommendations for a healthy lifestyle and daily patterns. It offers guidelines to help individuals make informed food choices and engage in physical activity.
* MyPlate: An internet-based tool that provides personalized dietary recommendations based on an individualâ€™s age, sex, and activity level. It visually represents the five food groups and promotes balanced eating.
* Exchange List for Meal Planning: A resource that helps with meal planning by providing standardized serving sizes for various food groups, particularly useful for people managing diabetes.
* Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs): These are a set of dietary standards that provide recommendations on the amount of nutrients needed to prevent deficiencies and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.
* Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA): The average daily intake level that is sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97-98%) healthy individuals in a particular life stage and gender group.
* Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges (AMDR): These ranges indicate the percentage of total daily calories that should come from carbohydrates, proteins, and fats to reduce the risk of chronic diseases while providing adequate nutrients.
* Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): The highest level of daily nutrient intake that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects for most individuals. Intake above this level may increase the risk of toxicity.
