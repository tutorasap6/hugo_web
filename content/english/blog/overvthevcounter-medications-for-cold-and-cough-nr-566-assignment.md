### Over-the-Counter Medications for Cold and Cough

***

#### 1. Antihistamines

* Active Ingredient: Diphenhydramine
* Uses:
  * Relief from runny nose
  * Alleviates itchy or watery eyes
* Special Considerations:
  * Has sedative and anticholinergic effects that can cause drowsiness.
  * Only doses that cause significant sedation can suppress a cough.
  * Caution: Antihistamines should not be the first line of treatment for a common cold as they may complicate the condition and increase symptoms.

#### 2. Decongestants

* Active Ingredient: Glucocorticoid
* Uses:
  * Relief of nasal congestion due to the common cold
* Additional Notes:
  * Helpful in reducing swelling in nasal passages and making breathing easier.

#### 3. Cough Suppressants (Antitussives)

* Active Ingredient: Dextromethorphan
* Uses:
  * Inhibits the cough center in the brain, reducing the urge to cough.
  * Mechanism: Elevates the threshold for coughing, making it less frequent.
* Indications for Use:
  * May be taken when a common cold or flu causes a cough that interrupts sleep or causes discomfort.
  * Suitable for chronic non-productive coughs.
* Special Considerations:
  * Cough Caused by Lung Diseases: Coughing due to lung diseases such as emphysema, asthma, or COPD should not be suppressed as it is necessary for clearing the lungs of foreign material.
  * When to Suppress Cough: Suppression is appropriate when the cough is non-productive, uncomfortable, or interrupts sleep.
* Example Medications:
  * Robitussin: Contains Dextromethorphan (OTC)
  * Benadryl: Contains Diphenhydramine (Also functions as an antihistamine)

#### 4. Expectorants

* Active Ingredients: Guaifenesin and Water
* Uses:
  * Helps thin and loosen mucus, making it easier to cough up.
  * Mechanism: Reduces the viscosity of tenacious mucus or phlegm, facilitating its expulsion.
