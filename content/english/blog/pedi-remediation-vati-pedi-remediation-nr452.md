Assess the patency of the airway, breath sounds, assess for shortness of breath, oxygen saturation, vital signs, position the child comfortably for breathing, and administer medications as prescribed.

   * Apply ice to the affected area.
   * Administer Tylenol (acetaminophen).
   * Put a gate across the stairs.
   * Apply knee and elbow protectors.All of the above are essential teaching points for a mother whose child has hemophilia.

4. Common laboratory and diagnostic tests associated with anorexia nervosa include hypokalemia, hypalbuminemia, anemia, elevated BUN and creatinine, ECG changes, abnormal blood glucose levels, and thyroid function tests.
