### Nutritional Assessment in a Preschool Facility: Cultural Focus

#### Introduction

* Objective: This presentation aims to conduct a nutritional assessment for preschool-aged children (2-5 years old) attending a preschool in a suburban area.
* Cultural Diversity: The facility serves students from various cultural backgrounds, including:
  * Hispanic
  * Caucasian
  * African-American
  * Asian

#### Current Menu Analysis

1. Breakfast:
   * Importance: Breakfast is considered the most important meal of the day as it provides essential energy and nutrients for young children.
   * Current Offering: Muffins and milk are served.
   * Nutritional Concern:
     * Muffins: High in sugar, which can cause a spike in energy levels followed by a rapid drop, leading to fatigue.
     * Milk: The current milk has a high-fat content.
   * Recommendations:
     * Substitute muffins with whole grain options such as oatmeal or whole wheat toast to provide sustained energy.
     * Replace high-fat milk with low-fat or fat-free milk to reduce saturated fat intake.
     * Incorporate an additional dairy product, such as yogurt or cheese, to meet the MyPlate guideline of 2 cups of dairy per day for preschoolers.
2. Lunch:
   * Current Offering: Chicken nuggets, rice, broccoli, and milk.
   * Nutritional Concern:
     * Chicken Nuggets: Processed food with potential high sodium and unhealthy fats.
     * Lack of Fruit: The meal lacks a fruit component, which is essential for a balanced diet.
   * Recommendations:
     * Replace chicken nuggets with a lean protein option, such as grilled chicken or beans, to reduce processed food intake.
     * Add a colorful variety of fruits and vegetables to make the plate more visually appealing and nutritious, in line with MyPlate recommendations.
     * Offer fat-free milk or a fruit serving to enhance the mealâ€™s nutritional value and ensure a balanced intake of nutrients.
3. Snack:
   * Current Offering: Graham crackers and apple juice.
   * Nutritional Concern:
     * Both items contain sugar, which may contribute to excessive sugar intake and potential issues with weight and dental health.
   * Recommendations:
     * Replace graham crackers with whole-grain crackers or a small portion of nuts, providing more fiber and protein.
     * Substitute apple juice with a whole fruit, such as an apple or orange, to provide fiber and reduce sugar intake.
