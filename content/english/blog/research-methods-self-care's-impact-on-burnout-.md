### Research Methods

#### Research Design

This study will utilize a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative research methods to explore the impact of self-care on burnout among healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. The quantitative component will involve a cross-sectional survey distributed to healthcare workers across various settings, while the qualitative component will consist of semi-structured interviews with a subset of participants to gain deeper insights into their experiences and perceptions.

#### Population and Sample

The population for this study will include healthcare professionals, such as nurses, doctors, and allied health workers, who have worked during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample will be drawn using a purposive sampling technique to ensure representation from different healthcare settings, including hospitals, clinics, and long-term care facilities. A sample size of 300 participants will be targeted for the survey, with 20 participants selected for follow-up interviews.

#### Data Collection

Data collection will occur in two phases. In the first phase, participants will complete an online survey that includes standardized instruments such as the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) to measure burnout levels and the Self-Care Assessment for Clinicians (SCA-C) to assess self-care practices. Demographic information and additional questions about workplace culture and leadership support during the pandemic will also be collected.

In the second phase, semi-structured interviews will be conducted with a subset of participants who consent to participate further. These interviews will explore participants' personal experiences with burnout, their self-care practices, and their perceptions of workplace support and leadership during the pandemic. Interviews will be conducted via video conferencing and recorded for transcription and analysis.

#### Data Analysis

Quantitative data from the survey will be analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Descriptive statistics will summarize the demographic characteristics, burnout levels, and self-care practices of the sample. Inferential statistics, including multiple regression analysis, will be used to examine the relationship between self-care practices, workplace culture, leadership support, and burnout levels.

Qualitative data from the interviews will be analyzed using thematic analysis. Transcripts will be coded to identify recurring themes related to self-care, burnout, and workplace support. The qualitative findings will provide context and depth to the quantitative results, offering a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing burnout among healthcare professionals during the pandemic.

#### Ethical Considerations

The study will adhere to ethical guidelines for research involving human subjects. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants, and they will be assured of their right to withdraw from the study at any time without penalty. The confidentiality and anonymity of participants will be maintained by assigning unique identifiers to survey responses and interview transcripts. Data will be stored securely, and only the research team will have access to the data.

#### Limitations

This study's limitations include potential self-report bias in the survey responses and the generalizability of the findings, given the use of a non-random sampling technique. Additionally, the study's cross-sectional design will limit the ability to infer causality between self-care practices and burnout levels.
