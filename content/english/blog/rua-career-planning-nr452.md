### Transition into the Professional Nursing Role

As I approach graduation and prepare to pass the NCLEX, my focus is on securing employment in the state of Nevada. The Nevada State Board of Nursing outlines several essential requirements for obtaining an RN license:

1. Graduation from an Approved Nursing School: The individual must graduate from a nursing program that is accredited and approved by the state.
2. Passing the NCLEX: Successfully passing the NCLEX-RN exam is mandatory to ensure competency in nursing practice.
3. U.S. Social Security Number: The applicant must have a valid U.S. Social Security number.
4. Fingerprint Submission: A fingerprint card must be completed and submitted as part of the background check process.
5. Fingerprint Clearance: The Nevada State Board of Nursing must receive and clear the individualâ€™s fingerprint reports to ensure there are no legal barriers to obtaining a license.

### Potential Employers

As a new graduate nurse, I have identified three potential employers in Nevada where I could begin my nursing career:

1. University Medical Center of Southern Nevada (UMC)
2. Acadia Healthcare
3. Spring Valley Surgery Center

Motivators for applying to these companies include:

* Mentorship Programs: These organizations offer mentorship opportunities, which are invaluable for new nurses transitioning into professional roles.
* Acceptance of New Graduates: They are open to hiring new graduate nurses, providing a supportive environment for beginners in the field.
* Competitive Benefits: Each of these employers offers competitive benefits packages that can support my professional and personal growth.

Deterrents that may impact my decision to apply include:

* Lack of Specific Graduate Programs: Some of these employers do not offer specific programs tailored for new graduates, which may be a challenge in gaining specialized experience.
* Experience Requirements: At least one year of nursing experience is often required, which may limit my opportunities as a new graduate.
* High Competition: The job market is competitive, and securing a position may be challenging due to the high number of applicants for these roles.

### Graduate Residency Program

One of the key opportunities I am considering is the Graduate Residency Program at UMC Hospital. This program is specifically within the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). However, it requires applicants to have a minimum of one year of experience and graduation from an accredited nursing school. Although this experience requirement presents a challenge, the residency program offers a structured and supportive environment that could significantly enhance my skills and confidence as I transition into the professional nursing role.

This career planning exercise is crucial as I begin my journey into the nursing profession. By understanding the requirements for licensure, identifying potential employers, and evaluating opportunities and challenges, I am positioning myself for a successful start in my nursing career in Nevada.
