### SBIRT Presentation: Alcohol and Its Impact

#### Introduction

I have decided to do my topic on Alcohol. Alcoholism is a major problem, with over "3 million cases a year" (Unknown, 2018). This affects many families. In Medina County in 2017, the needs assessment indicated that "71% of Medina County adults had at least one alcoholic drink in the past month. Fifteen percent (15%) of adults drove a vehicle or other equipment after consuming any alcoholic beverages" (Joseph A. Dake, 2017).

Expansion:
Alcoholism, or Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), is a chronic disease characterized by an inability to control alcohol consumption despite harmful consequences. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that alcohol is a causal factor in more than 200 disease and injury conditions, with approximately 3 million deaths globally every year (World Health Organization, 2018). The prevalence of alcohol consumption and its associated risks, such as driving under the influence (DUI), are significant public health concerns. In Medina County, the 71% statistic represents a broader national trend where excessive alcohol consumption is a leading cause of preventable deaths (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \[CDC], 2020).

#### Addiction/Problem Description

Alcoholism is when individuals can no longer control their use of alcohol, compulsively abuse it despite negative ramifications, and may also experience emotional distress when they are not drinking. With drinking comes driving, and then it's the issue of DUIs and motor vehicle crashes. According to the Ohio State Patrol website, there have been 187 OVI arrests. According to "The 2017 County Health Rankings, there have been 97 motor vehicle deaths related to alcohol" (Johnston, 2017).

Expansion:
Alcohol addiction is a multifaceted disorder that affects individuals physically, psychologically, and socially. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) classifies Alcohol Use Disorder based on criteria such as the inability to reduce alcohol intake, spending a significant amount of time drinking or recovering from its effects, and experiencing withdrawal symptoms (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Alcoholism often leads to risky behaviors, including driving under the influence, which remains a leading cause of traffic-related fatalities. In Ohio, the correlation between alcohol consumption and traffic accidents is alarmingly high, with the 187 OVI (Operating a Vehicle Impaired) arrests reflecting a critical public safety issue (Ohio State Highway Patrol, 2017).

The economic burden of alcohol-related accidents is also considerable. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates that alcohol-impaired driving costs the United States approximately $44 billion annually (NHTSA, 2018). In Medina County, the 97 motor vehicle deaths related to alcohol underscore the need for effective interventions, such as Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT), to mitigate the impact of alcohol misuse on communities.

### Expansion on Content

The SBIRT model is an evidence-based practice used to identify, reduce, and prevent problematic use of alcohol and other substances. SBIRT consists of three components: Screening, which quickly assesses the severity of substance use and identifies the appropriate level of treatment; Brief Intervention, which focuses on increasing insight and awareness regarding substance use and motivation toward behavioral change; and Referral to Treatment, which provides those identified as needing more extensive treatment with access to specialty care (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration \[SAMHSA], 2019).

Alcohol-related disorders are not only prevalent in Medina County but across the United States. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), in 2019, approximately 14.5 million adults aged 18 and older had Alcohol Use Disorder (NIAAA, 2020). The public health approach to addressing alcoholism includes prevention strategies such as SBIRT, which has been shown to reduce alcohol consumption among individuals who engage in hazardous drinking.

Furthermore, the implementation of SBIRT in primary care settings has proven effective in reducing alcohol misuse and its associated harms. A study published in the Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment found that SBIRT was associated with a 40% reduction in heavy alcohol use among participants (Babor et al., 2017). The brief intervention component of SBIRT, in particular, is designed to motivate individuals to reduce alcohol consumption by highlighting the risks associated with their drinking behaviors and discussing potential strategies for change.

### Conclusion

Alcoholism remains a significant public health issue with widespread implications for individuals, families, and communities. By utilizing interventions like SBIRT, healthcare providers can effectively identify and address alcohol misuse, thereby reducing the incidence of alcohol-related harm. The data from Medina County reflects broader national trends, emphasizing the need for continued research, prevention efforts, and policy initiatives to combat the pervasive effects of alcohol addiction.
