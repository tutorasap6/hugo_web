A 68-year-old female patient has recently been diagnosed with osteoporosis and has been prescribed alendronate (Fosamax). Which of the following instructions should the clinician provide as part of the patientâ€™s education?

A. "Take this medication right before going to bed."
B. "Take this medication with food to reduce stomach irritation."
C. "Take this medication with plain water on an empty stomach."
D. "Take this medication with juice to help with absorption."

### Correct Answer:

C. "Take this medication with plain water on an empty stomach."

### Explanation:

Alendronate (Fosamax) is a bisphosphonate used to treat osteoporosis by preventing bone breakdown and increasing bone density. Proper administration is crucial for its effectiveness and to prevent adverse effects:

* Option A: It is incorrect to take the medication before going to bed because it can cause irritation to the esophagus if the patient lies down immediately after taking it.
* Option B: Taking alendronate with food is not advised as food can significantly reduce the absorption of the medication, making it less effective.
* Option D: Alendronate should not be taken with juice or any liquid other than plain water, as other beverages can interfere with the absorption of the drug.

### Question 4:

When methimazole is initiated for the treatment of hyperthyroidism, how long may it take to see a complete reversal of hyperthyroid symptoms?

Options:

* A. 6 to 12 months. (Correct)
* B. 2 to 3 months.
* C. 1 to 2 months.
* D. 4 to 5 months.

### Correct Answer:

A. 6 to 12 months.

### Explanation:

Methimazole is an antithyroid medication used to manage hyperthyroidism by inhibiting the production of thyroid hormones. Although patients may experience some symptom relief within a few weeks, it often takes 6 to 12 months for a total reversal of hyperthyroid symptoms as the hormone levels stabilize.

### Question 5:

Secondary hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by which of the following?

Options:

* A. Autoimmune disease.
* B. Congenital defect.
* C. Pituitary adenoma. (Correct)

### Correct Answer:

C. Pituitary adenoma.

### Explanation:

Secondary hypothyroidism occurs when there is insufficient stimulation of the thyroid gland due to a problem with the pituitary gland, often caused by a pituitary adenoma, which can disrupt the production of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).

### Question 6:

Which of the following insulins has a duration of action of up to 42 hours, making it an ultra-long-acting insulin?

Options:

* A. Degludec (Tresiba). (Correct)

### Correct Answer:

A. Degludec (Tresiba).

### Explanation:

Degludec (Tresiba) is an ultra-long-acting insulin that has a duration of action of up to 42 hours, providing more flexible dosing schedules and potentially improving glycemic control.

### Question 7:

A 68-year-old female has just been diagnosed with osteoporosis and has been prescribed alendronate (Fosamax). Which of the following should the clinician include in the patient's education?

Options:

* A. "Take this medication right before going to bed."
* B. "Take this medication with juice to help it absorb better."
* C. "Take this medication with plain water on an empty stomach." (Correct)

### Correct Answer:

C. "Take this medication with plain water on an empty stomach."

### Explanation:

Alendronate (Fosamax) is a bisphosphonate that needs to be taken with plain water on an empty stomach, typically first thing in the morning. The patient should remain upright for at least 30 minutes after taking it to prevent esophageal irritation and ensure proper absorption.

#### Question 2

The onset, peak, and duration of isophane insulin (NPH) are which of the following?

Options:

* A. Onset = 5-30 minutes; Peak = 0.5-3 hours; Duration = 3-4 hours.
* B. Onset = 1-2 hours; Peak = none; Duration = 20-24 hours.
* C. Onset = 1-2 hours; Peak = 4-10 hours; Duration = 10-16 hours. (Correct Answer)
* D. Onset = 30-60 minutes; Peak = 2-4 hours; Duration = 3-7 hours.

Correct Answer:C. Onset = 1-2 hours; Peak = 4-10 hours; Duration = 10-16 hours.

Explanation:
Isophane insulin (NPH) has an onset of 1-2 hours, a peak action between 4-10 hours, and a duration of 10-16 hours, making it an intermediate-acting insulin used to control blood glucose levels.

***

#### Question 3

Insulin lowers blood glucose by which of the following mechanisms?

Options:

* A. Inhibits fat storage and enhances mobilization of fat for energy.
* B. Decreases storage of glucose as glycogen in muscle and liver cells.
* C. Stimulates glucose entry into cells as an energy source. (Correct Answer)
* D. Enhances glucose formation from non-carbohydrate sources, such as amino acids.

Correct Answer:C. Stimulates glucose entry into cells as an energy source.

Explanation:
Insulin lowers blood glucose levels primarily by stimulating the uptake of glucose into cells, where it is used as an energy source. This action helps to decrease blood glucose levels and is a key mechanism in maintaining glucose homeostasis.

### Question 2:

The onset, peak, and duration of isophane insulin (NPH) are which of the following?

Options:

* A. Onset = 5-30 minutes; Peak = 0.5-3 hours; Duration = 3-4 hours.
* B. Onset = 1-2 hours; Peak = none; Duration = 20-24 hours.
* C. Onset = 1-2 hours; Peak = 4-10 hours; Duration = 10-16 hours. (Correct Answer)
* D. Onset = 30-60 minutes; Peak = 2-4 hours; Duration = 3-7 hours.

Correct Answer:C. Onset = 1-2 hours; Peak = 4-10 hours; Duration = 10-16 hours.

Explanation:
Isophane insulin (NPH) has an onset of 1-2 hours, a peak action between 4-10 hours, and a duration of 10-16 hours, making it an intermediate-acting insulin. This timing allows it to control blood glucose levels for a significant portion of the day or night.

### Question 3:

Insulin lowers blood glucose by which of the following mechanisms?

Options:

* A. Inhibits fat storage and enhances mobilization of fat for energy.
* B. Decreases storage of glucose as glycogen in muscle and liver cells.
* C. Stimulates glucose entry into cells as an energy source. (Correct Answer)
* D. Enhances glucose formation from non-carbohydrate sources, such as amino acids.

Correct Answer:C. Stimulates glucose entry into cells as an energy source.

Explanation:
Insulin primarily works by stimulating the entry of glucose into cells, particularly muscle and adipose cells, where it is used as an energy source. This process is critical for lowering blood glucose levels and is the primary mechanism by which insulin controls glucose homeostasis.
