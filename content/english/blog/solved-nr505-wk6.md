### Question 1:

How has your understanding of biomedical research been influenced by learning about the history of research ethics?

### Answer:

Learning about the history of research ethics has profoundly influenced my understanding of the responsibilities inherent in conducting biomedical research. Historical cases such as the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, where African American men were denied treatment for syphilis without their knowledge, and the use of Henrietta Lacks' cells without her consent, have illuminated the devastating consequences that can result from unethical research practices (Brandt, 1978; Skloot, 2010). These examples have highlighted the critical need for ethical guidelines and federal regulations, such as those established in the Belmont Report, to protect the rights and dignity of research participants (National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research, 1979). My understanding of biomedical research has been shaped by these lessons, making me more conscious of the ethical implications of research and the importance of prioritizing the well-being of participants in every study.

### Question 2:

In reflecting on the studies you've examined for your PICOT question, do you believe that contemporary researchers adequately protect the rights of human subjects? If not, what further measures would you suggest?

### Answer:

In reflecting on the studies I reviewed for my PICOT question, I believe that contemporary researchers generally do an adequate job of protecting the rights of human subjects. Most studies I encountered included comprehensive informed consent processes, where participants were fully informed about the nature of the research, potential risks, and benefits, as well as their rights to withdraw at any time. Additionally, Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) provide oversight to ensure that studies comply with ethical standards and federal regulations, such as the Common Rule (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2018).

However, there is always room for improvement. One area where additional measures could be beneficial is in the ongoing monitoring of participants' well-being throughout the duration of a study. While initial IRB approval and informed consent are critical, continuous oversight could help address any unforeseen issues that may arise. This could include regular check-ins with participants, enhanced adverse event reporting, and increased transparency regarding study progress. Another area for improvement is ensuring that research studies include a diverse range of participants, which would help ensure that the benefits and risks of research are shared equitably across different populations.
