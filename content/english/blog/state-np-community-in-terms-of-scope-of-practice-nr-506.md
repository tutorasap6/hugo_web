### State NP community in terms of scope of practice NR 506

Scope of Practice for Nurse Practitioners (NPs) in Massachusetts

The scope of practice for Nurse Practitioners (NPs) in Massachusetts has seen significant progress in recent years, particularly with the enactment of legislation granting Full Practice Authority (FPA). This change is critical in a state that has long grappled with healthcare access issues, especially in rural and underserved communities. The move towards FPA not only enhances the ability of NPs to provide comprehensive care but also addresses healthcare disparities that have persisted for years.

### Level of Independence of Practice in Massachusetts

Full Practice Authority (FPA) Implementation:As of January 1, 2021, Governor Charlie Baker signed into law a provision granting Full Practice Authority to NPs in Massachusetts. This legislation followed an emergency executive order during the COVID-19 pandemic, which temporarily expanded the scope of practice for NPs. With the new law, Massachusetts became the 23rd state to grant NPs the authority to practice independently, joining 22 other states, the District of Columbia, and two U.S. territories in embracing FPA legislation (Massachusetts Medical Society, 2021).

Standardized Procedure Guidelines (SPGs):Before the implementation of FPA, NPs in Massachusetts were required to practice under Standardized Procedure Guidelines (SPGs). These guidelines were developed collaboratively by healthcare organizations to ensure that NPs adhered to the standards established by the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Nursing (Massachusetts Department of Public Health, 2020). SPGs typically outlined the scope of practice, specific clinical procedures, and decision-making protocols. For instance, a SPG might include protocols for managing chronic conditions such as diabetes, where NPs followed evidence-based guidelines to monitor patient progress and adjust treatment plans accordingly.

With FPA now in place, NPs in Massachusetts have the autonomy to evaluate patients, diagnose conditions, order and interpret diagnostic tests, and initiate and manage treatments independently. This autonomy is particularly beneficial in rural and underserved areas, where healthcare access has been a longstanding issue.

### Prescribing Authority

Prescriptive Authority in Massachusetts:Under the new FPA law, NPs in Massachusetts have the legal authority to prescribe medications, including controlled substances. However, current regulations still require that Certified Nurse Practitioners (CNPs) register with the Department of Public Health and establish a supervisory agreement with a physician to prescribe Schedule II-VI drugs (Massachusetts Department of Public Health, 2020). Additionally, Schedule II drug prescriptions given by Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs) must be reviewed within 96 hours and may be subject to random retrospective reviews (American Association of Nurse Practitioners, 2021).

Impact of Prescriptive Authority:The ability to prescribe medications independently is a significant advancement for NPs in Massachusetts. However, the requirement for physician oversight in prescribing controlled substances can limit the efficiency and autonomy of NPs, particularly in rural areas where physician availability may be scarce. This limitation can affect the timeliness of care and the ability of NPs to manage patient conditions comprehensively.

### Limitations of Practice

Existing Limitations Despite FPA:Despite the progress made with FPA, there are still limitations on NP practice in Massachusetts. One significant restriction is the requirement for a supervisory agreement with a physician for prescribing controlled substances. This requirement can be a barrier to fully autonomous practice and may hinder the ability of NPs to provide timely and comprehensive care, especially in areas with physician shortages (Poghosyan & Carthon, 2017).

Impact on Healthcare Delivery:The requirement for physician oversight in prescribing controlled substances can lead to delays in care, particularly in rural and underserved areas. This can result in patients not receiving timely treatment, potentially exacerbating health conditions and increasing the burden on emergency departments and urgent care centers (Poghosyan, Boyd, & Clarke, 2016).

### Process for Obtaining Licensure in Massachusetts

Steps to NP Licensure:To become a licensed Nurse Practitioner in Massachusetts, individuals must follow a series of steps:

1. Complete an Accredited Nursing Program: The first step is to complete an accredited nursing program that prepares individuals for advanced practice roles.
2. Take the NCLEX Exam: After completing the nursing program, individuals must pass the NCLEX exam to obtain licensure as a Registered Nurse (RN).
3. Apply for Licensure: Once the NCLEX is passed, individuals can apply for a Massachusetts nursing license.
4. Pursue a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Nursing (BSN): While it is possible to become an RN with an associate's degree, those aiming to become NPs typically pursue a BSN. This degree provides the foundational knowledge necessary for advanced practice roles.
5. Obtain Advanced Practice Education: After becoming an RN, individuals must complete a graduate-level education in nursing or an NP program, which includes coursework in advanced pathophysiology, pharmacology, and health assessment (Massachusetts Board of Registration in Nursing, 2020).

### Certification and Education Requirements for Licensure

National Certification and Continuing Education:Before taking the national certification exam, APRNs in Massachusetts must complete an approved graduate-level nursing or NP program that includes 30 hours of pharmacotherapeutics education. After completing their education, NPs must pass a national certifying examination and maintain active board certification by an approved certifying body, such as the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses (AACN), the American Association of Nurse Practitioners (AANP), or the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) (Massachusetts Board of Registration in Nursing, 2020).

### Impact of Practice Restrictions on Patient Care

Challenges in Rural and Underserved Areas:Massachusetts is home to many rural communities that are geographically isolated and have limited access to healthcare resources. These localities are often underserved, with few healthcare providers available to meet the needs of the population. The implementation of Full Practice Authority is crucial in these areas, especially when a physician may leave and recruiting another could take months. Without FPA, residents in these regions would be forced to travel great distances for care or might not receive care at all (Dillon & Gary, 2017).

Impact on Emergency Departments:In Massachusetts, the restricted practice environment before FPA often led to overcrowded emergency departments (EDs), as patients in rural areas had limited access to primary care providers. The lack of timely care often resulted in patients using the ED for primary care needs, leading to long wait times and strain on the healthcare system (Poghosyan et al., 2016).

### Access to NPs and Healthcare Disparities

Reducing Healthcare Disparities:Access to NPs plays a critical role in addressing healthcare disparities, particularly in rural and underserved areas. States that limit or reduce NPs' ability to practice according to their full training and education are often linked to geographic healthcare imbalances, greater chronic disease burdens, primary care shortages, increased costs of care, and lower national health rankings (Poghosyan & Carthon, 2017).

Improving Access to Care:The independent practice of NPs in Massachusetts has resulted in improved access to healthcare, particularly in rural and underserved areas. By allowing NPs to practice to the full extent of their training and education, FPA has reduced the strain on emergency departments, provided more timely care, and increased access to preventive services. This has the potential to significantly reduce healthcare disparities and improve overall health outcomes (Xue, Ye, Brewer, & Spetz, 2016).

### Conclusion

The recent legislation in Massachusetts granting Full Practice Authority to Nurse Practitioners marks a significant advancement in healthcare access and delivery. While there are still some limitations, such as the requirement for supervisory agreements for prescribing controlled substances, the overall impact of independent NP practice has been positive. By expanding the role of NPs, Massachusetts is better equipped to meet the healthcare needs of its population, particularly in rural and underserved areas, and to reduce healthcare disparities. As more states move towards FPA, the potential for NPs to contribute to a more equitable and efficient healthcare system will continue to grow.
