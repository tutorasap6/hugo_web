### NR 630 Week 7 Assignment: Project Management Paper – The Rise of Patient Sitters and the Financial Burden on Organizations

### Introduction

The role of patient sitters has become increasingly significant in healthcare settings, particularly in hospitals where the need for constant patient observation and safety is paramount. At Houston Methodist Willowbrook Hospital, the rise in the need for patient sitters has led to unforeseen financial implications. This paper examines how well patient sitters are utilized at the hospital, the financial impact of their employment, and the reasons behind the additional costs incurred. The analysis will include a discussion on the utilization of patient sitters, their financial implications, and potential solutions to mitigate the financial burden.

### Utilization of Patient Sitters

Patient sitters play a crucial role in ensuring patient safety, particularly for those at high risk of falls or self-harm. At Houston Methodist Willowbrook Hospital, the utilization of patient sitters has been substantial, with 34 full-time equivalent (FTE) sitters working an average of 4,574 hours per year. The high number of hours worked by patient sitters indicates a significant reliance on their services. This reliance is often driven by patient needs, including those requiring constant monitoring due to medical conditions, behavioral issues, or recovery from surgery.

In assessing how well patient sitters are utilized, several factors should be considered:

1. Demand for Sitters: Understanding the specific reasons for the increased demand for patient sitters, such as patient acuity levels and hospital policies, provides insight into their utilization.
2. Staffing Efficiency: Evaluating whether the number of patient sitters and their hours align with patient needs and hospital practices helps determine if resources are being used effectively.
3. Impact on Patient Care: Examining how the presence of patient sitters influences patient outcomes and safety can validate their role and necessity within the hospital.

### Financial Implications of Patient Sitters

The financial impact of employing patient sitters at Houston Methodist Willowbrook Hospital is significant. With patient sitters working an average of 4,574 hours per year, the costs associated with their employment include salaries, benefits, and training expenses. The additional 34 FTE patient sitters utilized in 2017, which were not forecasted in the budget, have contributed to unplanned financial expenditures.

To quantify the financial implications:

1. Cost Analysis: Calculate the total annual cost of employing patient sitters, including wages, benefits, and any additional costs associated with their roles.
2. Budget Variance: Assess the difference between the budgeted amount for patient sitters and the actual expenditures. This variance highlights the financial strain placed on the hospital due to unforeseen staffing needs.
3. Comparison to Industry Standards: Compare the number of hours worked by patient sitters at Houston Methodist Willowbrook Hospital with industry norms to determine if the hospital's usage is typical or excessive.

Policies and Procedures for Patient Sitters

Effective management of patient sitters requires clear policies and procedures. These guidelines should address:

1. Patient Requirements: Define the criteria for determining when a patient sitter is needed, including patient conditions and risk factors.
2. Sitter Responsibilities: Outline the responsibilities and duties of patient sitters to ensure they are effectively managing patient safety and adhering to hospital protocols.
3. Training and Qualifications: Specify the training and qualifications required for patient sitters to ensure they are competent and capable of performing their roles.
4. Supplemental Materials: Provide any additional resources or materials needed for patient sitters to perform their tasks efficiently.

### Sitter Solutions

To address the financial burden associated with patient sitters, several solutions can be considered:

1. Optimizing Utilization: Review and adjust the use of patient sitters to align with patient needs and hospital policies, potentially reducing the number of hours required.
2. Technology Integration: Explore the use of technology, such as remote monitoring systems, to supplement or reduce the need for in-person patient sitters.
3. Resource Allocation: Assess the allocation of resources to ensure that patient sitters are used where they are most needed, and explore alternative staffing options if appropriate.
4. Budget Forecasting: Improve budget forecasting and planning to account for fluctuations in the need for patient sitters and mitigate the impact of unexpected costs.

### Conclusion

The rise in the need for patient sitters at Houston Methodist Willowbrook Hospital has resulted in significant financial implications. Understanding how patient sitters are utilized, analyzing the associated costs, and evaluating the policies and procedures governing their roles are essential for managing this financial burden. By implementing effective solutions and improving budget forecasting, the hospital can better manage the costs related to patient sitters and enhance overall financial stability.
