## (Free Solution) Week 2: COPD Case Study Part 1

### Week 2: COPD Case Study Part 1 (Initial post due Tuesday, faculty and peer responses due Sunday)

PurposeProblem-based learning (PBL) is a teaching methodology aimed at developing students' clinical reasoning skills by solving real patient problems in the same manner they would be encountered in practice. The purpose of this activity is to enhance students' clinical reasoning abilities using a case-based learning exercise. Through participation in an online discussion forum, students will identify learning issues in a self-directed manner, which helps facilitate learning for the entire group.

Activity Learning OutcomesThrough this discussion, the student will demonstrate the ability to:

1. Competence in Evaluation and Management: Demonstrate competence in the evaluation and management of common respiratory problems. (WO 2.1) (CO 2, 3, 4, 5)
2. Differentiation of Lung Diseases: Distinguish between obstructive and restrictive lung diseases. (CO 2, 4)
3. Development of Management Plan: Develop a management plan for the case study patient based on identified primary, secondary, and differential diagnoses. (WO 2.2) (CO 2, 4)
4. Interpretation of Pulmonary Function Tests: Interpret pulmonary function test results. (WO 2.3) (CO 2, 4)

Due Date:

* Initial Post: The student must enter the initial post to Part 1 by 11:59 p.m. MT on Tuesday.
* Responses: The student must respond substantively to at least one topic-related post of a peer, including evidence from appropriate sources, and respond to all direct faculty questions in Part 1 by Sunday, 11:59 p.m. MT.
* Late Penalty: A 10% late penalty will be imposed for discussions posted after the Tuesday 11:59 p.m. MT deadline, regardless of the number of days late. NOTHING will be accepted after 11:59 p.m. MT on Sunday (i.e., the student will receive an automatic 0).

Total Points Possible: 50
