### (Free Answer) NR 525 Week 3 Case Study Discussion Part 1: Failure of the Skills Exam

### Introduction:

In the given scenario, Susie Student has filed a grievance after failing the Final Skills Exam on sterile technique. As the chair of the grievance committee, it is critical to gather pertinent information from both Susie and the faculty member who graded her. This will ensure that the grievance is addressed fairly and based on evidence. Below are key questions that would be directed to Susie and the faculty member, along with the rationale for each question.

### Questions for Susie Student:

1. Rationale: This question allows Susie to recount her actions during the exam. Understanding her perspective on how she performed the procedure can help determine whether she followed the established guidelines or if there were any deviations that may have led to her failing the exam.
2. Rationale: Feedback during or after the exam is crucial for understanding whether Susie was aware of any mistakes she might have made and whether the faculty member communicated these issues effectively. This will help assess if the faculty's communication was clear and aligned with the evaluation criteria.

### Questions for the Faculty Member:

1. Rationale: It is essential to understand the criteria the faculty member used to evaluate Susie's performance. This question will help determine if the evaluation was based on standardized guidelines or if there was any subjective interpretation that could have influenced the grading.
2. Rationale: This question seeks to gather detailed observations from the faculty member about Susie’s performance. Identifying the specific errors or deviations is important to establish whether Susie’s failure was justified based on the observed actions.

### Relevance of Questions to the Grievance Committee Decision:

The questions directed at Susie and the faculty member are crucial for uncovering the facts surrounding the skills exam and Susie's performance. By understanding Susie's perspective and the faculty member's evaluation criteria and observations, the grievance committee can assess whether the exam was graded fairly and according to the established guidelines.

The questions aim to reveal any discrepancies between Susie’s understanding of the sterile technique and the faculty member’s interpretation of the guidelines. If inconsistencies are found in the evaluation process, the committee can make an informed decision on whether Susie’s grievance has merit.

### Supporting Scholarly Evidence:

A key aspect of effective evaluation in nursing education is the use of objective and standardized assessment tools. According to a study by Lee and Lee (2017), objective criteria and clear communication are vital in clinical skills assessment to ensure fair grading and student success. Therefore, understanding whether standardized guidelines were applied in Susie’s evaluation is crucial to resolving this grievance fairly.

### Conclusion:

In summary, the questions presented to Susie and the faculty member will help the grievance committee determine whether the failure of the sterile technique exam was justified. The relevance of these questions lies in their ability to reveal both sides of the story, ensuring that the committee's decision is evidence-based and just.
