NR526 Advanced Pathophysiology, Health Assessment, and Pharmacology for Nurse Educators
Week 3 Clinical Questioning Assignment Guidelines & Scoring Rubric

***

#### Purpose

The purpose of this assignment is to provide educator students with a tool for working with nursing students and staff members when they are caring for complex healthcare cases.

#### Course Outcomes

Through this assignment, the student will demonstrate the ability to:

* CO 3: Integrate pathophysiologic mechanisms with advanced assessment and pharmacologic concepts to maximize patient outcomes in complex disease states. (PO 1, 4)
* CO 5: Analyze risk factors associated with complex disease states in individuals, aggregates, and populations to devise effective disease management and/or health promotion strategies that reflect pertinent psychosocial, cultural, legal, ethical, and safety considerations. (PO 4, 6)
* CO 7: Examine mechanisms and processes of homeostatic, adaptive, and compensatory physiological functions in complex disease states with an emphasis on appropriate assessment strategies and pharmacologic interventions. (PO 1, 4)
* CO 8: Determine clinical data essential to identifying specified pathophysiologic or psychologic problems and the best plan of care. (PO 1, 4)
* CO 10: Correlate changes and disruptions in major physiological systems and pathophysiological mechanisms with clinical data resulting from physical examination, laboratory data, and diagnostic test data with anticipated pharmacologic treatment. (PO 1, 4, 11)

#### Due Date

Sunday 11:59 p.m. MT at the end of Week 3

### Assignment Requirements

In this assignment, you are the Nursing Professional Development Specialist (NPD specialist)—formerly referred to as the “staff educator”—tasked with assisting your assigned new graduate nurse in applying the nursing process.

As the NPD specialist, you will not only take care of your patient at an advanced level, but you will also incorporate advanced physical assessment findings, pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the presenting disease, and the appropriate pharmacologic treatment approach. Additionally, you must consider the educational needs of your orientee, ensuring they understand and can apply the concepts to similar clinical situations in the future.

***

### Essay Requirements

Your essay should address the following components:

1. Patient Assessment and Disease Overview
   * Conduct a detailed physical assessment of the patient, identifying key findings.
   * Discuss the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the patient’s disease process.
   * Explain how these mechanisms affect the patient’s overall health and prognosis.
2. Pharmacologic Interventions
   * Identify the pharmacologic treatment options available for managing the patient’s condition.
   * Provide a rationale for the selected treatment plan, considering the patient’s clinical presentation and any potential side effects or contraindications.
3. Nursing Process Application
   * Describe how you would guide the new graduate nurse in applying the nursing process to manage the patient’s care.
   * Include specific steps for assessing, diagnosing, planning, implementing, and evaluating the patient’s care.
4. Educational Component
   * Discuss the educational strategies you would use to teach the new graduate nurse about the patient’s condition, assessment techniques, and treatment options.
   * Highlight any tools or resources you would provide to reinforce learning.
5. Evaluation and Reflection
   * Evaluate the new graduate nurse’s understanding and application of the concepts discussed.
   * Reflect on how you would adjust your teaching approach based on their performance and feedback.

### Total Points Possible: 250
