Week 5 NR505 Research Summary Franklin

The research summary for Week 5 of the NR505 Advanced Research Methods course at Chamberlain College of Nursing focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of educational interventions in increasing HPV vaccination rates among adolescents. The PICOT question driving this research asks whether implementing an HPV educational program can result in a 25% increase in vaccination rates within one year among adolescents aged 13-17.

### Albright et al. (2017)

In their study titled "Noninitiation and Noncompletion of HPV Vaccine Among English- and Spanish-Speaking Parents of Adolescent Girls: A Qualitative Study," Albright and colleagues aimed to understand the reasons why English- and Spanish-speaking parents did not initiate or complete the HPV vaccine series for their adolescent daughters. This qualitative study, part of a larger two-part research project, employed focus groups and semi-structured interviews with parents of girls aged 12-17 years in Denver, Colorado. The study found that healthcare providers need to improve their recommendations, coordination, and follow-up efforts to ensure better vaccine uptake. However, the study's limitations include its small sample size, focus on a single metropolitan area, and reliance on participants familiar with the HPV vaccine. Despite these limitations, the findings are relevant to the PICOT question, as they provide insights into the barriers that educational programs must address to increase vaccination rates.

### Cruz et al. (2016)

Cruz and colleagues conducted a study titled "Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccination Motivators, Barriers, and Brochure Preferences Among Parents in Multicultural Hawai‘i: A Qualitative Study." The research sought to understand the motivators and barriers that influence HPV vaccination decisions among multicultural parents in Hawaii. The qualitative study involved interviews with parents who were the primary caregivers responsible for their children's immunizations. The study identified several key factors influencing parental decisions, including the crucial role of physicians and the importance of culturally tailored educational materials. Limitations of the study include the small sample size and its focus on female participants, which may affect the generalizability of the findings. Nonetheless, this study's emphasis on cultural factors aligns with the PICOT question by highlighting the need for culturally sensitive educational programs to increase vaccination rates.

### Garbutt et al. (2018)

In their mixed-methods study, "Barriers and Facilitators to HPV Vaccination in Primary Care Practices: A Mixed-Methods Study Using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research," Garbutt and colleagues aimed to identify and categorize the barriers to implementing national HPV vaccination recommendations. The study involved participants from the Washington University Pediatric and Adolescent Ambulatory Research Consortium, with data collected from medical records and physician interviews. The study concluded that many individuals are exposed to HPV before receiving the vaccine, emphasizing the need for strategies to increase vaccine acceptance. The study's limitations include its small sample size and focus on a single geographical area, which may not represent the broader population. The findings support the PICOT question by underscoring the importance of educational programs that address both patient and provider barriers to vaccination.

### Javid et al. (2016)

Javid and colleagues conducted a study titled "Human Papillomavirus Vaccine Uptake in Texas Pediatric Care Settings: A Statewide Survey of Healthcare Professionals." The research aimed to identify barriers and facilitators to HPV vaccine uptake among children aged 9-17 in Texas. The study used a qualitative survey method, involving participants from various professional organizations in Texas. The findings highlighted communication issues between providers and parents and misconceptions about HPV as significant barriers to vaccination. Limitations of the study include the inability to determine the response rate and potential selection bias. The study's relevance to the PICOT question lies in its identification of communication barriers that educational programs must address to improve vaccine uptake.

### Kasting et al. (2016)

Kasting and colleagues explored healthcare providers' awareness and informational needs regarding the nine-valent HPV vaccine in their study "A Qualitative Study of Healthcare Provider Awareness and Informational Needs Regarding the Nine-Valent HPV Vaccine." The study involved semi-structured interviews with healthcare providers in Indianapolis and found that providers had unmet educational needs regarding the new vaccine, which could affect their ability to recommend it effectively. Limitations include the use of convenience sampling and potential selection bias among respondents. The findings highlight the need for targeted educational interventions for healthcare providers, which is essential for the success of the HPV educational program proposed in the PICOT question.

### Kornides et al. (2018)

The study by Kornides and colleagues, "Associations between Parents’ Satisfaction with Provider Communication and HPV Vaccination Behaviors," examined the relationship between parental satisfaction with provider communication and HPV vaccination behaviors. The study used an online cross-sectional survey and found a direct correlation between effective communication and higher vaccination rates. However, the study's cross-sectional design limits its ability to establish causality. Despite this limitation, the study's findings support the PICOT question by emphasizing the importance of provider communication in increasing vaccine uptake.

### Kulczycki et al. (2016)

Kulczycki and colleagues' study, "Recommend, but also Discuss: Different Patterns of Physician-Perceived Barriers to Discussing HPV Vaccination and Their Association with Vaccine Administration in 11–12-Year-Old Girls," explored how physicians' discussions with patients and perceived barriers affect HPV vaccination rates. The study used a quantitative regression method and involved participants from the American Medical Association. The findings suggest that educational programs should focus on enhancing physician communication skills to increase vaccination rates. Limitations include the small sample size and reliance on physician self-reports. The study's relevance to the PICOT question lies in its emphasis on the need for educational programs that address physician communication barriers.

### Perkins et al. (2014)

Perkins and colleagues conducted a study titled "Missed Opportunities for HPV Vaccination in Adolescent Girls: A Qualitative Study," which examined why parents and providers postpone HPV vaccination for girls. The study involved semi-structured interviews with parents and providers and identified several reasons for vaccine hesitancy, including lack of information, concerns about safety, and the perceived association between vaccination and sexual activity. The study's limitations include its small, non-random sample and focus on a specific geographical area. The findings underscore the importance of addressing these concerns in educational programs to increase vaccination rates, as proposed in the PICOT question.

### Rosen et al. (2017)

Rosen and colleagues' study, "Human Papillomavirus Vaccine Sources of Information and Adolescents’ Knowledge and Perceptions," assessed the impact of different sources of information on adolescents' knowledge and perceptions of the HPV vaccine. The study found that social media and healthcare providers were the most influential sources of information, with clinicians playing a crucial role in shaping positive perceptions of the vaccine. The study's limitations include its cross-sectional design and potential bias due to self-reported data. The findings are relevant to the PICOT question as they highlight the importance of targeted information dissemination to improve vaccination rates.

### Young et al. (2018)

Young and colleagues conducted a study titled "Information Needs of Young Women Vaccinated Against HPV Attending Colposcopy: A Qualitative Study," which explored the informational needs of young women undergoing colposcopy after receiving the HPV vaccine. The study found that while participants had a basic understanding of the HPV vaccine, they lacked comprehensive knowledge about HPV infections and cervical cancer. The study's limitations include the potential for updated information from clinicians during the colposcopy, which could influence participants' responses. The findings emphasize the need for ongoing education about the limits of the HPV vaccine, which is crucial for the success of the educational program proposed in the PICOT question.

Overall, the reviewed studies provide valuable insights into the barriers and facilitators associated with HPV vaccination, which are critical for designing effective educational programs aimed at increasing vaccination rates among adolescents. These findings support the PICOT question by highlighting the need for targeted, culturally sensitive, and well-communicated educational interventions.
