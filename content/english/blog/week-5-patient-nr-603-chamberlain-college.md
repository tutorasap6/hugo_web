Assessment:

Primary Diagnosis:

1. Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) (ICD-10: F32.9)
   * Rationale: The patient presents with symptoms indicative of MDD, including fatigue, loss of interest in activities, feelings of worthlessness, weight gain, and decreased concentration. The presence of a family history of depression and bipolar disorder further supports this diagnosis.

Differential Diagnoses:

1. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) (ICD-10: F41.1)
   * Rationale: Although the patient reports significant stress related to her job and feelings of worthlessness, the absence of pervasive worry and anxiety symptoms over various domains makes GAD less likely compared to MDD.
2. Hypothyroidism (ICD-10: E03.9)
   * Rationale: Hypothyroidism can present with fatigue, weight gain, and depressive symptoms. Given the patientâ€™s complaints and family history of thyroid issues (mother with hypothyroidism), this condition should be considered.
3. Knee Osteoarthritis (ICD-10: M17.11)
   * Rationale: The patient reports pain and stiffness in the right knee, which may be indicative of osteoarthritis, especially given her BMI, which places additional stress on the joints.

Diagnostic Testing:

1. Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP): To rule out any underlying metabolic issues contributing to the patient's fatigue and weight gain.
2. Thyroid Function Tests (TSH, Free T4): To evaluate for hypothyroidism as a potential cause of her symptoms.
3. Complete Blood Count (CBC): To assess for anemia or other hematologic conditions that could be contributing to fatigue.
4. PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9): A screening tool for depression to assess the severity of depressive symptoms.
5. Knee X-ray: To evaluate the right knee pain and assess for osteoarthritis or other structural abnormalities.

Plan:

* Medications:
  * Initiate a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) such as sertraline 50 mg daily for depression.
  * Consider prescribing an NSAID for knee pain if osteoarthritis is confirmed.
* Lifestyle Modifications:
  * Encourage a balanced diet and regular physical activity to manage weight.
  * Recommend cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for managing depressive symptoms.
* Referrals:
  * Referral to a mental health specialist for further evaluation and management of depression.
  * Referral to an orthopedic specialist if knee pain persists or worsens.
* Follow-Up:
  * Schedule a follow-up visit in 2-4 weeks to assess the effectiveness of treatment and make any necessary adjustments.
  * Monitor mood, energy levels, and any side effects from medications.

Education:

* Discuss the importance of adherence to prescribed medications and attending therapy sessions.
* Educate the patient on the potential side effects of SSRIs and the importance of gradual titration.
* Emphasize the importance of a support system, including involving family members in her care.

Outcome Goals:

* Improvement in mood, energy levels, and overall functioning.
* Reduction in knee pain and improvement in mobility.
* Achieve a BMI within the normal range through lifestyle changes.
