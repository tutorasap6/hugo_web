### Week 6 Discussion NR305

### Paragraph One

Question:
Patients of any age, gender, cultural background, or socio-economic status can be victims of violence. Consider a patient population you are currently working with or have worked with in the past. For what type of violence might they be at risk? What are some related findings that might alert you to investigate further?

Answer:
In my experience working with the elderly population, they are at significant risk of elder abuse, which can manifest in various forms such as physical abuse, emotional abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation. Elderly patients may be particularly vulnerable due to their dependency on caregivers, isolation, and cognitive decline, which can make them easy targets for abusers.

Some related findings that might alert a healthcare provider to investigate further include unexplained bruises, cuts, or injuries that the patient cannot clearly explain, frequent hospital visits for similar injuries, and signs of malnutrition or dehydration. Additionally, behavioral changes such as increased anxiety, depression, withdrawal from social interactions, and a sudden reluctance to speak in the presence of a caregiver could be indicators of emotional abuse. Financial exploitation may be suspected if there are sudden changes in the patient's financial situation, such as missing valuables or unexplained withdrawals from their bank accounts.

### Paragraph Two

Question:
Screening for signs of violence and abuse is a part of patient health history assessments. Have you observed the questions being asked by nurses or have you asked them to patients? Do you believe these screenings are typically completed in detail? Explain your answer.

Answer:
Yes, I have observed nurses asking screening questions related to violence and abuse as part of patient health history assessments. However, the thoroughness of these screenings can vary depending on the situation and the nurse's level of comfort and experience in addressing sensitive topics.

In my experience, while some nurses do conduct these screenings in detail, ensuring that they create a safe and non-judgmental environment for the patient to disclose any concerns, others may rush through the questions due to time constraints or discomfort in discussing potentially distressing topics. This can result in missed opportunities to identify and address violence or abuse.

As a nurse working with veterans, I have noticed that this population can be particularly vulnerable to various forms of violence, including domestic violence, PTSD-related aggression, and substance abuse-related violence. When screenings are not conducted thoroughly, significant issues may go unnoticed, leading to a lack of necessary intervention and support for these individuals. It is essential for healthcare providers to approach these screenings with the seriousness and empathy they require, as early detection can be crucial in preventing further harm to the patient.
