Week SIX Reflection

What kind of group does Tom discuss that can determine your success or failure?

Tom discusses the concept of a "Reference Group" and how it can significantly impact one's success or failure. He emphasizes that you will become the combined average of the people you spend the most time with.

How many people does he suggest hanging around, and what are the three areas you and your “people” will experience together?

Tom suggests that you should surround yourself with five people who have a positive influence on your life. The three areas that you and these individuals will experience together are:

1. Combined attitude, which includes the emotional states you share.
2. Combined health, which encompasses your health and fitness habits.
3. Combined income, which refers to your financial and success habits.

Do you think you can identify your “people” that you spend most of your time with?

Yes, I can identify the people I spend most of my time with. Reflecting on my growth, I realize that in my younger years, I had many people around me who influenced me both positively and negatively. However, as I have aged, I have come to appreciate my alone time and have become more selective about my social circle. Now, my circle is much smaller and consists of friends with whom I share common goals. These friends are goal-oriented, ambitious, business-minded, positive, supportive, and self-aware. They are not just for fun, but they contribute to my growth and success.
