### Assessment (A):

1. Insomnia related to stress and environmental changes: Likely related to her recent move, ongoing divorce, and sharing a room with her children.
2. Ongoing stress and fatigue: Due to the significant life changes, including divorce and financial concerns.
3. Amenorrhea: Possibly related to stress, hormonal imbalance (history of PCOS), or other underlying conditions.
4. Risk of depression or anxiety: Despite the absence of a formal history, the current life stressors suggest the need for close monitoring.

### Plan (P):

1. Sleep Hygiene Counseling:
   * Educate K.F. on the importance of establishing a bedtime routine, limiting screen time before bed, and creating a restful environment.
   * Discuss the potential negative effects of using Advil PM and alcohol as sleep aids and explore alternative methods such as relaxation techniques or herbal supplements (e.g., melatonin) if appropriate.
2. Stress Management:
   * Recommend counseling or therapy to help manage stress related to the divorce, financial concerns, and changes in her living situation.
   * Suggest mindfulness practices, such as meditation or yoga, to help reduce stress levels.
3. Further Evaluation of Amenorrhea:
   * Order blood work to assess hormone levels, including thyroid function tests and reproductive hormones (FSH, LH, estradiol).
   * Consider a pelvic ultrasound to evaluate for any structural abnormalities given her history of PCOS and amenorrhea.
4. Nutrition and Lifestyle:
   * Advise on the importance of regular meals and balanced nutrition to support overall health and energy levels.
   * Encourage light exercise, such as walking, to improve mood and energy levels.
5. Follow-Up:
   * Schedule a follow-up appointment in 4-6 weeks to assess progress with sleep, stress management, and the results of any ordered tests.
   * Monitor for any signs of depression or worsening anxiety, and consider referral to a mental health specialist if needed.
