  content: >-
    The ordering process is done in three simple steps;  1. Fill in your order
    details on the order form (Order AI free Paper Here). This will include your
    contact details as well as the assignment instructions. There is also the
    facility to attach instruction files if you have any, the upload/attach
    files button will appear after placing the order. For orders that are a
    continuation of a previous order, share the previous order details or upload
    the previous paper.   2. The second step is to make the payment so that the
    most qualified writer is assigned your paper. This step is important because
    writing cannot commence before the payment is made. You can check out safely
    using any debit or credit card, or funds in your wallet.  3. After the
    payment, you can now relax, the order is in progress and will be delivered
    to you before your set deadline.  NB. For Proctored online exams, iHuman, 
    Shadowhealth, Full Online Classes, etc,  use the live online chat option(at
