Our money-back guarantee is designed to give our students peace of mind and the assurance that they will not be charged for services they are not satisfied with. If you are not satisfied with a tutoring session for any reason, you may be eligible for a refund. To be eligible for a refund, you must request it within 24 hours of the tutoring session. We will review your request and determine whether you meet the eligibility criteria. If you do, we will issue a refund to your original payment method within 7 business days. We believe that our money-back guarantee sets us apart from other tutoring services and demonstrates our commitment to our students' success. We want our students to be completely satisfied with the services they receive, and we believe that our money-back guarantee is an important part of that commitment.

Please note that refunds are only available for tutoring sessions that have been paid for in advance through our online payment system. Refunds will not be issued for sessions that have already been completed and paid for.

We understand that the decision to seek tutoring services can be a difficult one, and we want our students to feel confident and comfortable with their decision. Our money-back guarantee is just one of the many ways we provide our students with the support and resources they need to succeed.
