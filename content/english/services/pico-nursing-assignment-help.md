  PICO is a popular framework for formulating clinical questions, especially
  those relating to therapy (or intervention) effectiveness.  It’s used to
  develop a well-built clinical question to aid in creating a search strategy.
  It helps identify searchable aspects of a situation in which a patient or
  population has a certain condition, and the outcome of interest is related to
  a therapy or intervention.      PICO stands for:  P –
  Populations/People/Patient/Problem I – Intervention(s) C – Comparison (if any)
  O – Outcome

      Creating research questions that align with PICO criteria is essential in
      evidence-based practice. Here are a few examples across different nursing
      specialties:  Geriatric Care: For elderly patients with dementia (P), does
