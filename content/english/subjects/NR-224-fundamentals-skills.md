## FAQs

**Question:A nurse is teaching a client how to perform personal ileostomy care prior to discharge. The client says, "I don't think that I am going to be able to take care of this myself." Which is the most appropriate response from the nurse?**

Answer: The most appropriate response from the nurse would be to provide reassurance and offer support to the client. The nurse can acknowledge the client's concerns and validate their feelings, while also emphasizing that learning to care for an ileostomy takes time and practice. The nurse can say something like, "It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed at first, but I'm here to help you learn and gain confidence in taking care of your ileostomy. We will go through the steps together, and I'll provide you with all the necessary information and resources to support you in managing it successfully. It may seem challenging at first, but with time and practice, I'm confident that you'll be able to take care of it yourself."

**Question: The adult child of a client who has had a colon resection will be caring for their parent at home. The client's son tells the nurse, "I don't know how I am going to care for my mom now." Which is the best nursing response?**

Answer: The best nursing response would be to provide support and offer resources to assist the client's son in caring for his parent. The nurse can say something like, "Caring for a loved one after surgery can be challenging, but you don't have to do it alone. We have resources and support available to help you navigate this new role as a caregiver. I can provide you with information, instructions, and demonstrations on how to care for your mom at home. Additionally, we have support groups and home health services that can offer further assistance. Together, we'll ensure that you have the knowledge and support you need to provide the best care for your mom."

**Question: A nurse in the medical-surgical unit is assigning client care to a nurse who is floating from PACU. The float nurse is most qualified to care for which client?**

Answer: The nurse who is floating from the PACU (Post-Anesthesia Care Unit) is most qualified to care for a client who has just undergone surgery and is in the immediate post-operative phase. The nurse from the PACU has experience in monitoring vital signs, assessing post-operative complications, managing pain, and providing care to clients recovering from anesthesia. Therefore, assigning this nurse to a post-operative client would be the most appropriate choice.

**Question: A client asks the nurse what causes constipation. Choose the best response by the nurse.**

Answer: The nurse should explain that constipation has many causes:

"Constipation has many causes. Lack of fiber, poor hydration intake, sedentary lifestyle, adverse effects of drugs, changes in habit or lifestyle, and medical problems including irritable bowel syndrome or hypothyroidism are major causes. To treat and prevent constipation, we must determine the cause.

**Question: The nurse caring for a post-operative client performs an abdominal assessment. The nurse does not hear any bowel sounds over the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. What is the most likely reason for this?**

Answer: Surgical manipulation or aesthetic effects are likely to prevent post-operative patients from hearing bowel noises in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. Post-operative manipulation and anesthetic can reduce or eliminate bowel noises. The nurse must monitor the client's bowel sounds and look for additional indicators of bowel dysfunction.

**Question: The nurse admits a client who is to undergo a colonoscopy. The nurse understands that this will be required in preparation for the procedure.**

Answer: The nurse knows colonoscopy patients need bowel preparation. Cleansing the colon before colonoscopy ensures good visibility. It usually entails a specific diet, clear drinks, and laxatives or bowel-cleansing products to empty the colon and remove feces. To ensure bowel preparation success, the nurse should give explicit instructions.

**Question: A nurse is teaching a client about colorectal cancer testing. The nurse expects the provider to first perform this test for colorectal screening.**

Answer: Colorectal cancer screening requires a colonoscopy, according to the nurse. Colonoscopy detects colorectal cancer and precancerous polyps best. A flexible tube with a camera is inserted into the colon to view the whole colon and rectum. Biopsies and polyp removal can be done during the colonoscopy. FOBT, FIT, sigmoidoscopy, and virtual colonoscopy (CT colonography) are other colorectal cancer screening modalities.

**Question: A nurse is caring for a client with a newly placed colostomy. The nurse teaches the client they may have formed stool after the bowel has healed because the surgeon placed the stoma where?**

Answer: The nurse informs the client that the surgeon placed the stoma in the descending or sigmoid colon, which may induce stool formation once the bowel heals. Water absorption solidifies stool in the descending and sigmoid colons. Stool can be collected in an ostomy pouch by placing the stoma here.

**Question: The nurse is administering a tap water enema to a client in preparation for bowel surgery. The nurse correctly positions the enema bag containing the fluid where?**

Answer: The nurse informs the client that the surgeon placed the stoma in the descending or sigmoid colon, which may induce stool formation once the bowel heals. Water absorption solidifies stool in the descending and sigmoid colons. Stool can be collected in an ostomy pouch by placing the stoma here.

**Question: The nurse correctly positions a client for a fleets enema by placing them in this position:**

Answer: The nurse informs the client that the surgeon placed the stoma in the descending or sigmoid colon, which may induce stool formation once the bowel heals. Water absorption solidifies stool in the descending and sigmoid colons. Stool can be collected in an ostomy pouch by placing the stoma here.
