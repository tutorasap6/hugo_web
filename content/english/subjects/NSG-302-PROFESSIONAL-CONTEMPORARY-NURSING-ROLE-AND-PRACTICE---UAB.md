## Samples Paper

Interprofessional Collaborative Practice Model (IPCP)

The “Triple Aim,” introduced by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010, emphasizes improving the patient’s experience of care, enhancing overall health, and reducing healthcare costs (Berwick et al., 2008; Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation, 2013). This national focus necessitated the development of interprofessional collaboration among healthcare providers and the creation of Interprofessional Collaborative Practice (IPCP) models.

IPCP Model

Interprofessional Collaborative Practice (IPCP) models represent an innovative and effective approach to delivering care to complex patient populations. According to the World Health Organization (2010), “An IPCP model harnesses the talents of multiple professions working together, thus facilitating the teamwork needed to deliver the highest quality of care across the healthcare continuum.”

An exemplary evidence-based practice model is the IPCP Team-Based Care Model, designed to provide care to a medically indigent population at the PATH (Providing Access to Healthcare) Clinic in Birmingham, Alabama. This model included team members from various disciplines, such as nursing, medicine, optometry, nutrition, mental health, social work, informatics, as well as undergraduate and graduate nursing students (Rosenberg, 2018). The collaborative approach featured regular daily activities facilitated by different professionals, including 15-minute morning stand-ups to review schedules and discuss potential concerns, and 30-minute end-of-day meetings to confer on patients seen, challenges faced, and strategies that worked or did not work.

The IPCP model's integration of diverse professional perspectives ensures comprehensive patient care, improving outcomes and efficiency. This model's success at the PATH Clinic underscores the importance of interprofessional collaboration in achieving the Triple Aim’s goals. The approach demonstrates how structured, team-based care can address complex healthcare needs while fostering professional growth and development among team members.
