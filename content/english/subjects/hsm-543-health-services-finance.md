## FAQs

Question: (CO G) This legislation made more restrictive eligibility criteria for welfare, which in turn restricted eligibility to Medicaid.

Answer: The legislation that made more restrictive eligibility criteria for welfare, which in turn restricted eligibility to Medicaid, is commonly known as the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996. This act implemented significant changes to the welfare system in the United States, including the establishment of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. The eligibility criteria for TANF and other welfare programs were tightened, which had an impact on the eligibility criteria for Medicaid as well.

Question: (CO G) The SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act included provisions for which of the following?

Answer: The State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) Benefits Improvement and Protection Act included provisions for various aspects related to children's healthcare. Some of the provisions included expanding access to healthcare coverage for uninsured children, improving outreach and enrollment efforts, enhancing benefits and services provided under SCHIP, promoting coordination between SCHIP and Medicaid programs, and strengthening quality and performance measurement for SCHIP.

Question: (CO E) For the capital budget, a step that is required just after identifying and prioritizing requests is to

Answer: After identifying and prioritizing capital budget requests, the next step is typically to analyze the financial feasibility of the requests. This involves evaluating the costs, benefits, and potential returns on investment for each capital project. It may include conducting financial analyses such as net present value (NPV), return on investment (ROI), payback period, and internal rate of return (IRR) calculations to determine the financial viability and feasibility of each project.

Question: (CO E) Budgeting is an important part of the planning process. Describe the relationship of budgeting to the operating plan.

Answer: Budgeting is an integral part of the planning process, particularly the operational planning phase. The operating plan outlines the specific activities, goals, and strategies that an organization intends to pursue to achieve its objectives. The budget, on the other hand, translates the operational plan into financial terms by allocating resources (such as funds, personnel, and materials) to support the planned activities.

The budget provides a detailed financial plan that aligns with the operational plan, specifying the anticipated revenues, expenses, and resource allocation for a given period (typically a fiscal year). It helps ensure that the organization's financial resources are allocated appropriately and in line with its strategic goals and operational priorities. The operating plan informs the budgeting process, providing the necessary inputs and guidance to develop a realistic and effective financial plan.

Question: (CO B) A major objective of healthcare financial management is to monitor physicians. This is important because

Answer: Monitoring physicians is an important aspect of healthcare financial management for several reasons. One major objective is to ensure appropriate utilization of resources, including medical services and procedures, which directly impact the financial health of healthcare organizations.

Monitoring physicians helps identify any patterns of overutilization or underutilization of services, which can have significant financial implications. By tracking and analyzing physicians' performance, healthcare organizations can identify opportunities for cost containment, improve operational efficiency, and optimize resource allocation.

Additionally, monitoring physicians' practices and adherence to established clinical guidelines and protocols promotes quality of care. It helps identify variations in practice patterns, enables performance comparisons, and facilitates the implementation of evidence-based practices. This can lead to better patient outcomes, increased patient satisfaction, and potentially reduced costs associated with preventable complications or ineffective treatments.

Question: (CO B) A proactive strategy uses all of the following direct measures to define and measure quality except for

Answer: A proactive strategy uses various direct measures to define and measure quality in healthcare. These measures typically include:

Clinical outcomes: These measures assess the results of care, such as mortality rates, complication rates, readmission rates, infection rates, and patient satisfaction scores. Clinical outcome measures provide insights into the effectiveness and safety of healthcare interventions.

Process measures: These measures evaluate the processes and procedures followed in delivering healthcare services. Examples include adherence to clinical guidelines, timely administration of medications, compliance with infection control protocols, and documentation accuracy.

Structural measures: These measures assess the resources and infrastructure of healthcare organizations, including the qualifications and training of healthcare professionals, availability of equipment and technology, and facility accreditation.

Patient-reported measures: These measures capture patients' perspectives and experiences of care, such as patient satisfaction surveys, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), and patient-reported experience measures (PREMs). These measures provide valuable insights into the patient's perception of quality and help identify areas for improvement.

Therefore, the statement in the question is incorrect. A proactive strategy uses all of the mentioned direct measures (clinical outcomes, process measures, structural measures, and patient-reported measures) to define and measure quality in healthcare.

Question: (CO D) The management tool or ratio most often used to evaluate inventory performance is the \___\__ ratio.

Answer: The management tool or ratio most often used to evaluate inventory performance is the inventory turnover ratio. The inventory turnover ratio is a financial metric that measures how efficiently a company manages its inventory. It calculates the number of times a company's inventory is sold and replaced within a given period.

The formula for inventory turnover ratio is:

Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory

A higher inventory turnover ratio indicates that inventory is being sold and replenished more frequently, suggesting efficient inventory management and better cash flow. Conversely, a lower inventory turnover ratio may indicate slower inventory turnover, excess inventory, or potential issues with sales and operations.

Question: (CO D) The most commonly used tool to evaluate accounts receivable performance is

Answer: The most commonly used tool to evaluate accounts receivable performance is the accounts receivable turnover ratio. The accounts receivable turnover ratio is a financial metric that measures how efficiently a company collects payments from its customers or clients.

The formula for accounts receivable turnover ratio is:

Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable

This ratio indicates the number of times, on average, a company collects its accounts receivable within a given period. A higher accounts receivable turnover ratio suggests that the company is collecting payments more quickly, which is generally favorable. Conversely, a lower ratio may indicate slower collections, potential issues with credit management or customer payments, and could negatively impact cash flow.

Question: (CO C) Explain the difference in per diem reimbursement in an acute care hospital versus an extended care facility.

Answer: The difference in per diem reimbursement between an acute care hospital and an extended care facility lies in the level and intensity of care provided.

In an acute care hospital, per diem reimbursement typically covers the cost of providing comprehensive medical services, including diagnosis, treatment, and management of acute illnesses or injuries. Acute care hospitals are equipped with specialized medical resources, such as advanced diagnostic equipment, operating rooms, and intensive care units. The reimbursement is generally higher to account for the higher costs associated with staffing, technology, and specialized services.

On the other hand, an extended care facility, such as a skilled nursing facility or a long-term care facility, provides care for individuals who require assistance with daily living activities or need ongoing medical supervision. The per diem reimbursement in extended care facilities is generally lower compared to acute care hospitals, as the level of care provided is less intensive and specialized.

Extended care facilities focus on providing long-term custodial care, rehabilitation services, and assistance with activities of daily living, rather than acute medical interventions. The reimbursement in extended care facilities often covers room and board, basic medical services, assistance with activities of daily living, medication administration, and social support services.

The difference in per diem reimbursement reflects the variation in the level and intensity of care provided by acute care hospitals and extended care facilities.
