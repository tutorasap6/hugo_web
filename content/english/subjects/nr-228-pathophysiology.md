## FAQs

**Question:** A cellular function that occurs in all cell types is:

**Answer:** All cells perform metabolism. The chemical reactions that keep a cell running are called metabolism. Energy, nutrition, macromolecule, and waste removal are involved. Life depends on metabolism.

Question: Active … transport involves:

Answer: Active transport moves molecules or ions through a cell membrane against their concentration gradient from low to high concentration. Transporters or pumps need ATP to facilitate this process. Active transport allows cells to maintain concentration gradients, import essential nutrients, export waste products, and perform other vital functions.

Question: The function of cellular energy metabolism and generation of most of the cell's adenosine triphosphate (ATP) occurs in the:

Answer: Mitochondria produce most of the cell's energy and ATP. Cells' "powerhouses"—mitochondria—are in the cytoplasm. Cellular respiration converts nutrients into ATP. ATP powers cells.

Question: Which of the following is the most common cause of cellular injury?

Answer: A lack of oxygen is the most common cause of cellular damage. Ischemia, breathing issues, heart failure, and significant blood loss can cause hypoxia. Cells is unable to function or live without oxygen in sufficient quantities.

Question: Which type of necrosis best describes death of a cell from hypoxia, generally as a result of ischemia in the lower extremities?

Answer: Dry gangrene best depicts hypoxia-induced cell death in the lower limbs. Dry gangrene occurs when blood flow to an area is substantially reduced or obstructed, killing tissue. Peripheral artery disease and arterial thrombosis cause it in the legs. Dehydration, coagulation, and mummification define dry gangrene.

Question: Which statement is TRUE with regard to cellular change due to aging?

Answer: Aging slows cellular repair and regeneration. Cells lose their ability to repair DNA, eliminate waste, and renew as they age. Cellular repair systems gradually deteriorate with age, increasing susceptibility to age-related illnesses and functional loss.

Question: Which of the following statements is TRUE?

Answer: Without specific statements provided, it is not possible to determine which statement is true. Please provide the options or specific statements for an accurate response.

Question: Which term best describes an allele with an observable effect?

Answer: Dominant alleles have detectable effects. When homozygous or heterozygous, dominant alleles express phenotypically. They can hide recessive alleles. Recessive alleles only express phenotypically when homozygous.

Question: Infusion of intravenous solutions promote movement of water into cells, thus making the cells:

Answer: Hypotonic intravenous fluids cause cells to swell. Hypotonic solutions force water into cells due to their lower solute concentration than intracellular fluid. This helps improve intracellular fluid content or cellular hydration.

**Question:** Which electrolyte is the main intracellular electrolyte?

**Answer:** Intracellular potassium (K+) dominates. Potassium, the major cation in cells, maintains membrane potential, regulates excitability, and participates in many cellular activities. Cells have more potassium ions than extracellular fluid. Mg2+ and HPO42- are also significant intracellular electrolytes.
