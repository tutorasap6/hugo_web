## FAQs

Question: An antacid (Maalox) is prescribed for a client with peptic ulcer disease. The nurse knows that the purpose of this medication is to

Answer: An antacid like Maalox helps peptic ulcer patients with heartburn, indigestion, and stomach pain by neutralizing stomach acid.

Question: In evaluating the effects of lactulose (Cephulac), which outcome would indicate that the drug is performing as intended?

Answer: Lactulose treats constipation and hepatic encephalopathy. Ammonia reduction in hepatic encephalopathy indicates that lactulose is working. Stool ammonia excretion by lactulose lowers blood ammonia.

Question: The healthcare provider prescribes digitalis (Digoxin) for a client diagnosed with congestive heart failure. Which intervention should the nurse implement prior to administering the digoxin?

Answer: Before giving congestive heart failure patients digoxin, nurses should assess their apical heart rate for a minute. Digoxin is a narrow-therapeutic-range heart failure and heart rhythm medicine. Digoxin can cause bradycardia or other heart rhythm issues, therefore if the client's heart rate is already low, administering the prescription could cause more problems.

Question: Following the administration of sublingual nitroglycerin to a client experiencing an acute anginal attack, which assessment finding indicates to the nurse that the desired effect has been achieved?

Answer: Sublingual nitroglycerin relieves chest pain in acute anginal attacks. A reduction or elimination of the client's chest pain would indicate success to the nurse.

Question: A client with congestive heart failure (CHF) is being discharged with a new prescription for the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril (Capoten). The nurse's discharge instruction should include reporting which problem to the healthcare provider?

Answer: The nurse should advise a congestive heart failure (CHF) client taking an ACE inhibitor such captopril to report any indications or symptoms of angioedema, a potentially dangerous side effect. Angioedema causes face, lip, tongue, and throat swelling and breathing problems.

Question: A client is being treated for hyperthyroidism with propylthiouracil (PTU). The nurse knows that the action of this drug is to:

Answer: PTU treats hyperthyroidism. PTU prevents the thyroid gland from synthesizing T3 and T4 hormones.

Question: A client with Parkinson's disease is taking carbidopa-levodopa (Sinemet). Which observation by the nurse would indicate that the desired outcome of the medication is being achieved?

Answer: Carbidopa-levodopa (Sinemet) treats Parkinson's disease. Reduced tremors or improved motor function are signs that the drug is working. Carbidopa-levodopa increases brain dopamine, which improves mobility and reduces tremors in Parkinson's patients.

Question: Following heparin treatment for a pulmonary embolism, a client is being discharged with a prescription for warfarin (Coumadin). In conducting discharge teaching, the nurse advises the client to have which diagnostic test monitored regularly after discharge?

Answer: After heparin treatment for a pulmonary embolism, the nurse would encourage the client to have their INR tested routinely. The INR test measures warfarin's anticoagulant effect. To prevent clotting or bleeding, the INR must be monitored regularly.

Question: A postoperative client has been receiving a continuous IV infusion of meperidine (Demerol) 35 mg/hr for four days. The client has a PRN prescription for Demerol 100 mg PO q3h. The nurse notes that the client has become increasingly restless, irritable, and confused, stating that there are bugs all over the walls. What action should the nurse take first?

Answer: The client's restlessness, irritation, bewilderment, and hallucinations (bugs on the walls) may indicate meperidine toxicity or buildup. The nurse should check the client's vital signs and oxygen saturation first to guarantee safety. The nurse should inform the healthcare professional of the client's symptoms and get further instructions.

Question: A client is being treated for osteoporosis with alendronate (Fosamax), and the nurse has completed discharge teaching regarding medication administration. Which morning schedule would indicate to the nurse that the client teaching has been effective?

Answer: Osteoporosis treatment often includes alendronate (Fosamax). The nurse should check if the client understands medication instructions to guarantee teaching effectiveness. Alendronate should be taken on an empty stomach at least 30 minutes before eating or drinking, and before taking any other drugs or supplements.
