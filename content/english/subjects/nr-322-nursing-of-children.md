While ulcerative colitis primarily affects the colon and rectum, Crohn's disease can affect any portion of the GI tract. Abdominal pain, diarrhea, and a loss of appetite could all be symptoms. Medication, dietary changes, and sometimes surgery are used in an effort to reduce inflammation and control symptoms.
