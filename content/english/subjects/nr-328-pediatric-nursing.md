## FAQs

**Question: (TCO 1) Which of the following is the best example of an off-time event that could have negative effects upon an individual's development?**

In the context of a person's regular or expected developmental timetable, something that occurs out of the ordinary at that time is said to be an off-time occurrence. The unexpected death of a parent, for instance, is the kind of life event that might have lasting consequences. A child's emotional, social, and cognitive growth may be negatively affected because of the difficulties associated with dealing with loss and grieving and transitioning to life without a parent.

**Question: (TCO 1) Of the following, which is the best example of naturalistic observation?**

In naturalistic observation, researchers just watch how subjects act in their everyday environments, unprompted.

There is evidence of a causal relationship between maternal smoking before, during, and after pregnancy and the increased risk of respiratory illness in the offspring. It shows a statistical correlation between two factors (maternal smoking and their offspring's risk of developing respiratory ailment). It does not prove a cause-and-effect connection, however, because the higher risk of respiratory illness could be due to other variables as well.
