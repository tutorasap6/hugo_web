## FAQs

**Question: A client admitted to the hospital with a subarachnoid hemorrhage has complaints of severe headache, nuchal rigidity, and projectile vomiting. The nurse knows lumbar puncture (LP) would be contraindicated in this client in which of the following circumstances?**

Answer: If there are symptoms of a high intracranial pressure (ICP) or a mass lesion, a spinal puncture (LP) should not be performed on a patient with a subarachnoid hemorrhage. A severe headache, nuchal stiffness (a stiff neck), and violent vomiting are all possible symptoms. In such instances, removing CSF and increasing intracranial pressure (ICP) by an LP could lead to brain herniation. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the client's state and discuss the LP with the healthcare physician prior to moving forward.

**Question: A client with a subdural hematoma becomes restless and confused, with dilation of the ipsilateral pupil. The physician orders mannitol for which of the following reasons?**

Answer: To lower intracranial pressure (ICP), mannitol is given to a person with a subdural hematoma who is restless and confused and whose pupil gets bigger on the same side. Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic. It works by pulling fluid out of brain tissue and into the bloodstream. This lowers brain swelling and intracranial pressure (ICP). It helps to improve blood flow to the brain and lower the chance of herniation in people with high ICP.

**Question: A client with subdural hematoma was given mannitol to decrease intracranial pressure (ICP). Which of the following results would best show the mannitol was effective?**

Answer: Mannitol's effectiveness in lowering intracranial pressure (ICP) is best measured by a client's ICP drop. Intraventricular or intraparenchymal fiberoptic catheters are typically used to monitor ICP. Healthcare practitioners can evaluate ICP-lowering therapies like mannitol by assessing cranial vault pressure. Mannitol reduces brain edema and skull pressure by lowering ICP.

**Question: Which of the following values is considered normal for ICP?**

Answer: In adults, ICP should typically hover around 15 mmHg (5–20 millimeters of mercury). Intracranial pressure (ICP) is a measure of the pressure inside the skull that is affected by several variables, including the amount of brain tissue, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) present. A high intracranial pressure reading may indicate an underlying pathology or damage.

**Question: Which of the following signs and symptoms of increased ICP after head trauma would appear first?**

Answer: Level of consciousness (LOC) changes are often the earliest and most sensitive indicators of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) after head trauma. Alterations in LOC can manifest as a wide range of symptoms, from mental clarity to agitation to sleepiness to coma. Headache, nausea, vomiting, altered pupillary responses, altered vital signs, and motor dysfunction may also ensue. It's crucial to remember, though, that these symptoms may present up in a different order or at different times for different people.

**Question: The nurse is assessing the motor function of an unconscious client. The nurse would plan to use which of the following to test the client's peripheral response to pain?**

Answer: The nurse can measure the client's peripheral response to a painful stimuli when evaluating motor function in an unconscious patient. The goal is to get a physical reaction from the client that reflects their mental status and health of their nervous system. To get a physical reaction, a frequent method is to provide an unpleasant stimuli like a pinch or a rub to the chest. The nurse can watch for any deliberate or reflexive motion as a result of the unpleasant experience.

**Question: The client is having a lumbar puncture performed. The nurse would plan to place the client in which position for the procedure?**

Answer: Nursing practice normally calls for the patient to be placed in the lateral recumbent position, also known as the side-lying position, for a lumbar puncture (LP). When the patient is in this posture, the spine can bend, widening the space between the vertebrae and making it easier to introduce the spinal needle into the subarachnoid region. In order to increase the distance between the client's vertebrae, they are typically instructed to assume the fetal posture, knees drawn up against the chest and chin tucked in.

**Question: A nurse is assisting with caloric testing of the oculovestibular reflex of an unconscious client. Cold water is injected into the left auditory canal. The client exhibits eye conjugate movements toward the left followed by a rapid nystagmus toward the right. The nurse understands that this indicates the client has:**

Answer: When cold water is injected into the left auditory canal, a normal oculovestibular reflex reaction occurs, characterized by leftward eye conjugate movements followed by fast nystagmus to the right. This reaction proves that the brainstem is healthy and operational. The vestibular system communicates with the cranial nerves responsible for eye movement via the oculovestibular reflex. When the vestibular system is stimulated by a cold stimulus, the eyes first drift to the unaffected side (left) before quickly re-centering themselves (rapid nystagmus).

**Question: The nurse is caring for the client with increased intracranial pressure. The nurse would note which of the following trends in vital signs if the ICP is rising?**

Answer: The nurse usually notes hypertension as a vital sign trend when intracranial pressure (ICP) rises. The body raises systemic blood pressure to sustain cerebral perfusion pressure due to increased ICP. The nurse may also notice a compensatory bradycardia. Hypertension, bradycardia, and abnormal respirations are called Cushing's triad.

**Question: The nurse is evaluating the status of a client who had a craniotomy 3 days ago. The nurse would suspect the client is developing meningitis as a complication of surgery if the client exhibits:**

Answer:

The nurse should suspect meningitis in a patient who underwent a craniotomy three days prior. Meningitis symptoms include:

Fever Headache

Neck stiffness

Photophobia (light-sensitivity)

Mental illness

Throwing up

Positive Kernig's sign (resistance and pain with knee extension while hip flexed)

Positive Brudzinski's sign (involuntary hip, knee, and neck flexion)

Meningeal irritation may cause these symptoms. Notify the authorities immediately.
