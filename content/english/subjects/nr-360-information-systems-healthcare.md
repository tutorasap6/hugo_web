## FAQs


**Question: Which is the five-step process that professional nurses use when caring for clients?**

Professional nurses employ the five-step nursing procedure to care for customers. Nursing procedural steps:

Assessment: The nurse assesses the client's physical, psychological, social, and environmental health.

Diagnosis: The nurse uses evaluation data to identify health issues or needs. This analysis informs nursing diagnoses.

Planning: The nurse creates a care plan with the client and other healthcare professionals. Goals, results, and interventions address health issues.

Implementation: The nurse executes treatments, drugs, patient education, and other nursing actions.

Evaluation: The nurse assesses the client's response to interventions and goals and outcomes. Nursing care is evaluated and adjusted as needed.


**Question: The nurse palpates a client's radial pulse as 52 beats per minute. The client appears alert and oriented and in no distress. Which action by the nurse best demonstrates effective use of the nursing process?**

The nurse assesses the client by palpating the radial pulse at 52 beats per minute and noticing that the client is attentive, oriented, and not in distress. The nurse is taking vital signs. This stage is essential for detecting abnormalities or changes that require additional assessment.


**Question: The nurse is assessing the client after being admitted from the emergency room. Which findings are objective data? (Select all that apply)**

Observation, physical examination, and diagnostic testing yield objective data. Objective data includes:

101.5 °F

22 breaths/min.

130/80 mmHg BP

Abdominal rash

Report of 12,000/mm3 white blood cells.

Subjective data are dependent on the client's perception and cannot be directly viewed or measured. Subjective data includes client-reported symptoms, sentiments, and concerns.


**Question: An elderly client with pneumonia has an elevated respiratory rate, decreased oxygen saturation, and a fever. The client also states that there are no family members that live in town. Which nursing diagnosis is the priority?**

The nursing diagnosis here is "Risk for Ineffective Airway Clearance." Fever, higher respiratory rate, and decreased oxygen saturation indicate respiratory distress and poor gas exchange, which might compromise airway clearance. The client's health may worsen if family members aren't around. To prevent respiratory problems and optimize oxygenation, airway clearance and respiratory function should be prioritized.


**Question: Which is the best method for nurses to use to reduce the spread of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs)?**

Infection prevention and control is the greatest way for nurses to prevent HAIs. It includes:

Hand hygiene: Proper handwashing or alcohol-based sanitizers.

Wearing gloves, masks, gowns, and other PPE to avoid contact with infectious items.

Safely disposing of needles, syringes, and other sharps and medical waste.

Environmental cleaning and disinfection: Properly cleaning and disinfecting patient care areas and equipment to maintain a clean and safe environment.

Standard precautions: Applying them to all patients to prevent infection.

Following manufacturer guidelines for use, cleaning, and sterilization or disinfection of reusable medical devices and equipment.

Education and awareness: Teaching healthcare workers and patients about infection prevention and infection control.


**Question: Which intervention breaks the chain of infection at the portal of entry?**

Protective barriers stop infection at the entry point. Gloves, masks, gowns, and eyewear protect. These barriers protect healthcare providers and patients from infectious pathogens. Gloves and a mask during an operation prevent infections from entering through mucous membranes or skin breaches.



**Question: The student nurse is reviewing the chain of infection. Which are considered portals of exit? (Select all that apply).**

Infectious agents depart through portals of exit. Common exits are:

Coughing, sneezing, or discharges.

Vomiting or feces.

Urinary tract: Urine, semen, vaginal secretions.

Blood: From cuts, needles, or other blood exposures.

Skin: Exudates, wounds, or lesions.

Mucous membranes: Eyes, nose, mouth.

Which standard/universal precaution statement is correct?

Standard/universal precautions safeguard healthcare workers and patients from infectious pathogens. Standard/universal precautions should be used on all patients, regardless of infection status. To prevent infection, healthcare providers should take the same precautions with every patient. Hand hygiene, PPE, sharps handling, and environmental cleaning are universal measures.



**Question: Which events occur during the convalescence stage of an infection?**

**The convalescence stage of an infection is the final stage, characterized by the recovery and healing of the body after the infection. During this stage, the following events occur:**

The immune system controls or removes the infectious pathogen.

Tissue healing: The body repairs infection-related damage.

Infection symptoms improve and eventually disappear.

Normal physiological function: The body recovers from infection.


**Question: When assessing a surgical incision, which signs and symptoms indicate surgical infection? (Select all that apply).**

**Signs and symptoms that may indicate a surgical infection when assessing a surgical incision include:**

Incision site redness and warmth

Incision swelling or hardening

Increased incision pain

Incision drainage or pus

Wound dehiscence or healing delays

High body temperature

Wound stench

These symptoms do not confirm a surgical infection, but they should raise concern and urge additional evaluation and treatment.
