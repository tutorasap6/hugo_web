## FAQs



**Question: Which nursing measures are implemented to prevent effects of immobility while hospitalized? (Select all that apply).**

Answer: Hospitalized nursing measures to avoid immobility include:

Turning and moving patients often to prevent pressure sores and improve circulation.

Helping the patient with active or passive range-of-motion exercises to prevent contractures.

Facilitating early ambulation and mobilization as tolerated.

Managing pain to ease movement.

Compression stockings or intermittent pneumatic compression devices to avoid DVT.

Promoting proper nutrition and hydration to prevent tissue damage and malnutrition.

Preventing urinary tract infections and skin breakdown by helping with toileting and cleanliness.



**Question: Which precaution is necessary when caring for a client with Clostridium difficile (C-Diff)?**

Answer: Contact precautions are needed for C-Diff patients. Entering the client's room with gloves and a robe prevents C-Diff spores. Since alcohol-based hand sanitizers don't kill C-Diff spores, handwashing with soap and water is essential. To avoid cross-contamination, use patient-specific equipment and supplies.



**Question: Which is a violation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)?**

Answer: HIPAA violations include improper disclosure or breach of patient privacy and confidentiality. HIPAA violations include:

Disclosing a patient's medical information.

Unattended patient records or charts.

illegally accessing patient records.

Publicly discussing patient information.

Unsecured patient data.

Unprotected email or faxing patient data.


**Question: The nurse is providing discharge teaching to an elderly patient with a chronic lung disease. Which recommendation provided by the nurse would be most beneficial to reduce host susceptibility?**

Answer: In older patients with chronic lung illness, yearly flu and pneumococcal immunizations reduce host susceptibility. These vaccines can protect against common respiratory infections and associated consequences, which can be severe in chronic lung disease patients. Reducing respiratory infection risk improves patient health and lung function.



**Question: Which client would be placed in a private room with negative air pressure?**

Answer: Clients with highly contagious airborne infections are housed in private rooms with negative air pressure. TB, measles, and varicella are examples. Negative air pressure in the room prevents airborne infections from escaping into the surrounding environment by forcing air inside the room. This isolation precaution protects the client and healthcare workers.



**Question: A client has a medical order for non-weight bearing to the injured left leg. What instructions are provided to the client about proper crutch use? (Select all that apply).**

Answer: If a client has a medical order for non-weight bearing on the damaged left leg, the following crutch use recommendations may apply:

Crutches on the unaffected side.

Use your arms and hands, not the injured leg.

Elevate the injured leg.

Fit crutches snugly beneath the arms.

Crutches' handgrips facilitate walking.

Advance the crutches and affected leg simultaneously.

These recommendations help the client maintain balance, stability, and weight distribution when using crutches and safeguard the wounded limb.



**Question: A client arrives at the emergency room with an oral temperature of 104.3 degrees Fahrenheit. He has been working outside in the yard most of the day. On assessment, his skin is hot and dry. Which condition does the nurse suspect?**

Answer: The client's oral temperature of 104.3 degrees Fahrenheit, hot and dry skin, and history of yard labor may indicate heat stroke to the nurse. Heat stroke is a severe heat-related sickness with hot and dry skin and a body temperature above 104 degrees Fahrenheit. Heat stroke requires quick cooling to prevent organ damage.


**Question: Which nursing diagnosis is the priority for a client with orthostatic hypotension?**

Answer: Orthostatic hypotension is a nursing diagnostic of "Risk for Falls." Orthostatic hypotension causes dizziness and falls by dropping blood pressure when standing or shifting postures. To protect the client, identify and reduce fall risk. Nursing interventions include gentle position adjustments, fall prevention education, and assistive equipment.



**Question: A nurse is caring for clients on a medical-surgical unit. The unlicensed assistive personnel (UAP) reports vital signs to the nurse. Which client should the nurse assess first?**

Answer: First, the nurse should evaluate the patient with aberrant vital signs. It's hard to decide which customer to check first without vital signs or symptoms. The nurse should prioritize clients with abnormal vital signs, indicators of deterioration, or UAP concerns.


**Question: A client who has been stable throughout the shift suddenly calls to the nurse and states that she "feels funny." What should the nurse do first?**

Answer: The nurse should immediately evaluate a stable client who suddenly feels "funny" or develops new symptoms. The nurse should first assess the client by evaluating vital signs, oxygen saturation, and physical health. The nurse can recognize and treat emergency or deteriorating problems with prompt assessment.
