NR 500NP Entire Course

NR 500NP is pretty easy, straightforward and 100% manageable course. Surely, not a bad course but just meant to refresh your knowledge of research methods and APA. I recently finished NR 500NP and believe the 8 weeks’ course is fine if you have a super supportive and great professor! Feel free to drop an email to ask questions along the way. We are here to support for all your course elements including assignments and discussions, good luck!
