## FAQs

Question 1: Where can providers find criteria for reviewing an internet site for rigor?

Professional organizations, academic institutions, and government entities can provide rigor standards for online site reviews. These sites provide guidelines for assessing internet health information quality and reliability. Sources include:

Health on the Net Foundation (HON): HON's Code of Conduct for medical and health websites addresses transparency, privacy, and information quality.

National Institutes of Health (NIH): The "Evaluating Internet Health Information" guidance includes criteria for analyzing online health information's reliability, accuracy, and relevance.

CDC: The CDC gives criteria for evaluating internet health information, including source, content, and currency.

To ensure the trustworthiness and integrity of online information, suppliers must thoroughly analyze their sources and follow evidence-based principles.

Question 2: Which of the following is an example of a secondary prevention strategy?

Secondary prevention:

Regular mammography screenings for early breast cancer detection: Mammography screenings detect breast cancer before symptoms appear to improve treatment outcomes.

Secondary preventive measures aim to detect and treat diseases early to reduce their severity. These strategies target those with risk factors or early illness indicators but no symptoms.

Question 3: Which of the following is an example of a tertiary prevention strategy?

Tertiary preventive strategies include:

Heart attack rehabilitation: Through lifestyle changes, exercise, medication management, and education, cardiac rehabilitation programs assist heart attack survivors recover, manage their condition, and prevent subsequent issues.

Tertiary preventive measures reduce complications, improve quality of life, and prevent disability or disease development after a disease has occurred.

Question 4: What are the criteria that should be considered for a screening test to be effective?

Screening tests must meet these characteristics to be effective:

Validity: The screening test should properly distinguish those with the ailment (sensitivity) and those without (specificity).

Reliability: Repeated screening tests should yield consistent results.

Acceptability: The screening test should be easy, comfortable, and culturally appropriate for the target demographic.

Accessibility: The screening test should be easily accessible to the target population.

Feasibility: Cost, resources, and healthcare infrastructure should make the screening program feasible.

Benefit-harm balance: Early detection and improved outcomes should exceed potential downsides like false-positive results, needless diagnostic testing, or unwanted consequences of therapies.

These criteria let screening tests identify people at risk for a disease or condition, allowing for early intervention and better health outcomes.

Question 5: Which of the following is a measure of exposure in a case-control study?

Case-control studies measure exposure:

Odds ratio: In a case-control study, the odds ratio measures the association between exposure (e.g., a risk factor or intervention) and the outcome (e.g., disease or condition). It compares case and control exposure odds.

Researchers can estimate the intensity and direction of the exposure-outcome relationship using the odds ratio.

Question 6: Which of the following is an example of a primary prevention intervention?

Primary preventative intervention:

Vaccinations against infectious illnesses are a typical primary preventative method. Vaccines prevent pathogen infection and transmission.

Addressing risk factors, promoting healthy habits, and reducing exposure to possible hazards are primary preventative approaches.

Question 7: Which of the following is an example of the determinants of health?

Health determinants:

Socioeconomic status includes wealth, schooling, occupation, and social class. It affects health outcomes because those with lower incomes have more difficulty getting healthcare, less money for healthy living, and increased stress and poorer health.

The influences on health are social, economic, environmental, and behavioral factors. The above factors influence many health outcomes and affect individuals and communities differently.

Question 8: Which of the following risks can contribute to an exposure?

Risks include:

Environmental risk: Exposure to environmental hazards. Pollutants, poisons, radiation, infectious agents, and dangerous compounds in air, water, soil, and the built environment are examples.

Understanding and managing environmental dangers can improve health and prevent bad health outcomes.

Question 9: Systematic error or bias is categorized into which of the following two groups?

Systematic mistake or prejudice falls into two categories:

Selection bias: The characteristics of those picked for a study differ from those not selected, resulting in over- or underrepresentation of specific groups. This can reduce study validity and generalizability.

Information bias: Measurement bias arises when exposure, outcome, or other variables of interest are measured incorrectly. Misclassification of individuals or outcomes can skew study results.

To enable credible research and data analysis, systematic errors and biases must be understood and addressed. Randomization, blinding, and standardized data collecting can reduce bias and improve study findings.

Question 10: Which of the following describes the importance of understanding "rates"?

Understanding "rates" is important in various contexts, including epidemiology and public health, as rates provide measures of occurrence, frequency, or risk of a particular event or condition within a specified population and time period. Rates are calculated by considering the number of events or cases in relation to the population at risk.

The importance of understanding rates includes:

Monitoring health trends: Rates help monitor the prevalence, incidence, or mortality rates of specific diseases or conditions over time. This information assists in identifying patterns, changes, or outbreaks, allowing for appropriate public health interventions and resource allocation.

Comparing populations: Rates enable comparisons between different populations or subgroups, helping identify disparities in health outcomes and informing targeted interventions to address inequities.

Assessing risk factors: Rates allow for the estimation of risk associated with certain factors, such as age, gender, or exposure to specific agents. This information helps in understanding the burden of diseases or conditions and evaluating the effectiveness of preventive measures.

Understanding rates provides valuable
