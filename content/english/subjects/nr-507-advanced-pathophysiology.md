## FAQs



**Question: The coronary ostia are located in the:**

The ascending aorta walls above the aortic valve include the coronary ostia. Right and left coronary ostia are common. These openings allow aortic blood to enter the coronary arteries, which oxygenate the heart muscle.



**Question: Which manifestations of Vaso occlusive crisis are associated with sickle cell disease (SCD) in infants?**

Vaso occlusive crises can cause acute discomfort, fever, hand and foot swelling, irritability, fussiness, and decreased appetite in sickle cell disease (SCD) newborns. Jaundice, priapism, and acute chest syndrome (chest discomfort, cough, and difficulty breathing) may also occur.



**Question: Decreased lung compliance means that the lungs are demonstrating which characteristic?**

Decreased lung compliance means stiffness or reduced lung expansion. It reduces lung capacity. Pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonia, and lung fluid accumulation can cause this.



**Question: What is the life span of an erythrocyte (in days)?**

Erythrocytes, or red blood cells, live 120 days. Red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to tissues and eliminate carbon dioxide. The spleen and liver remove old red blood cells after 120 days, and bone marrow produces new ones.



**Question: Infants are most susceptible to significant losses in total body water because of an infant's:**

Due to their bigger body surface area, higher metabolic rate, and immature kidney function, infants lose more total body water. Their higher metabolic rate requires more water, and their immature kidneys cannot concentrate urine and preserve water. Infants are especially susceptible to dehydration since they have more body fluids.



**Question: Causes of hyperkalemia include:**

Hyperkalemia is high blood potassium. Acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease, potassium-sparing diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, adrenal gland disorders like Addison's disease, tissue trauma or burns, acidosis, and excessive potassium intake can cause hyperkalemia.



**Question: Erythrocyte life span of less than 120 days, ineffective bone marrow response to erythropoietin, and altered iron metabolism describe the pathophysiologic characteristics of which type of anemia?**

Hemolytic anemias are associated with erythrocyte lifespans of less than 120 days, poor bone marrow response to erythropoietin, and abnormal iron metabolism. Hemolytic anemias cause premature red blood cell breakdown and anemia. Hemolytic anemias include autoimmune, inherited, and sickle cell.


**Question: The lung is innervated by the parasympathetic nervous system via which nerve?**

The vagus nerve (tenth cranial nerve or pneumogastric nerve) controls lung parasympathetic innervation. The vagus nerve regulates bronchoconstriction, mucus secretion, and airway smooth muscle tone through parasympathetic fibers.



**Question: When an individual aspirates food particles, where would the nurse expect to hear decreased or absent breath sounds?**

The nurse expects to hear fewer or no breath sounds in the afflicted lung when food particles are aspirated. Food particles can block airways and limit sound transmission. The nurse may also notice coughing, wheezing, or increased breathing effort.



**Question: Which T-lymphocyte phenotype is the key determinant of childhood asthma?**

Th2-lymphocytes are important in pediatric asthma. Th2 lymphocytes release inflammatory cytokines such IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, which cause airway inflammation, mucus formation, and eosinophil recruitment. Immune responses cause asthma's bronchoconstriction and airway hyperresponsiveness.



**Question: What is the final stage of the infectious process?**

Resolution or convalescence ends the infectious process. The immune system destroys or controls the infectious pathogen in this stage. The person recovers when the infection symptoms fade. Infection type and intensity determine convalescence length.
