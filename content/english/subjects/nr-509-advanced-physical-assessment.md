## NR 509 Advanced Physical Assessment: Mastering the Art of Health Evaluation: Comprehensive Support for Your Coursework

You have found [NR 509, "Advanced Physical Assessment,"](http://www.nursingschooltutors.com/) where you will learn the finer points of conducting a thorough physical examination and making an accurate diagnosis. The numerous systems of the body, from the digestive system to neurological and musculoskeletal evaluations, will be covered in depth in this course to better prepare you for clinical practice.

Subheadings:

## NR 509 Week 6 Alternative Writing Assignment for Week 5 – The Gastrointestinal System:

[NR 509 WEEK 6 Alternate writing tasks](http://www.nursingschooltutors.com/) will allow you to delve deeply into the digestive system and hone your knowledge and analytical skills.

### Week 5 Alternative Writing Assignment

#### HEENT1 Assessment

The Head, Eyes, Ears, Nose, and Throat (HEENT) assessment is typically the initial part of a general physical exam and focuses on the patient's specific complaints across these five systems. When conducting a complete exam, it should be performed systematically from the top (head) to the bottom (neck). Common or concerning symptoms prompting a HEENT assessment include headaches, head injuries, visual disturbances, flashing lights, eye pain, eye redness, double vision, hearing loss, tinnitus, earaches, ear discharge, vertigo, rhinorrhea, epistaxis, sore throats, coughs, gum bleeding, swollen glands, and goiters.

Beginning with a thorough history of the patient's medical background and current symptoms is crucial. The assessment employs specific devices such as an otoscope, ophthalmoscope, or tongue depressor to gather vital information about the patient’s health. This comprehensive approach helps lay the foundation for developing an initial patient care strategy.

#### Physiology of the Body System

Understanding the anatomy of the abdomen is essential when assessing abdominal pain. The right upper quadrant (RUQ) contains the liver, gallbladder, right kidney and adrenal gland, hepatic flexure of the colon, head of the pancreas, and parts of the ascending and transverse colon. The left upper quadrant (LUQ) includes the spleen, left kidney and adrenal gland, stomach, left lobe of the liver, body of the pancreas, splenic flexure of the colon, and parts of the transverse and descending colon.

The right lower quadrant (RLQ) contains the appendix, cecum, right ureter, right iliac artery, and, in females, the right ovary and fallopian tube. In males, the right spermatic cord is located in this quadrant. The left lower quadrant (LLQ) houses the sigmoid colon, part of the descending colon, left iliac artery, and left ureter. In females, the left ovary and fallopian tube are present, while in males, the left spermatic cord is found in this quadrant.

#### Gastrointestinal Assessment

The gastrointestinal (GI) assessment requires a review of common or concerning symptoms, which include changes in appetite, weight gain or loss, dysphagia, intolerance to certain foods, nausea, vomiting, changes in bowel habits, and abdominal pain. When assessing appetite, inquire if the patient has experienced any changes in appetite or food intake. If changes are reported, further investigate potential gastrointestinal diseases, socioeconomic factors (such as food availability and cultural practices), and any loss of taste.

By conducting a thorough HEENT and gastrointestinal assessment, healthcare practitioners can obtain crucial information to guide the patient's care and management plan.

## FAQs

Question: An older patient has been diagnosed with pernicious anemia. The FNP knows that this condition could be related to

Answer Vitamin B12 deficiency causes pernicious anemia, which prevents red blood cell synthesis. This disease prevents vitamin B12 absorption from the gut. Antibodies that assault intrinsic factor-producing stomach cells induce pernicious anemia. Intestinal vitamin B12 absorption requires intrinsic factor. Thus, intrinsic factor deficiency or autoimmune gastric parietal cell destruction cause pernicious anemia.

Question: The FNP is examining a patient who tells the FNP "I sure sweat a lot, especially on my face and feet, but it doesn't have an odor." The FNP knows that this could be related to

Answer: Hyperhidrosis is unscented sweating. Genetics, physical issues, medicines, and stress can cause it. In this situation, the patient's excessive sweating on the face and feet without an odor may be due to primary focal hyperhidrosis, which causes excessive sweating on the palms, soles, and face. Medical conditions rarely cause primary focal hyperhidrosis.

Question: During an abdominal assessment, the FNP elicits tenderness on light palpation in the right lower quadrant. The FNP interprets that this finding could indicate a disorder in which of these structures?

Answer: The appendix may be inflamed if the right lower quadrant of the abdomen is tender to touch. This is often related with appendicitis. Untreated appendicitis can become serious.

Question: An Inuit visiting Nevada from Anchorage has come to the clinic in July during the hottest part of the day. It so happens that the clinic's air conditioning is broken and the temperature is very hot. The FNP knows that which of these statements is true about the Inuit's sweating tendencies?

Answer: Genetics, environment, and physiological responses affect sweating. Colder climates, like the Inuit, may have fewer sweat glands. The Inuit may have difficulty cooling down due to their lesser sweat gland density.

Question: The FNP notices that a patient has black, tarry stool and recalls that a possible cause would be

Answer: Melena—black, tarry stool—may indicate upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Blood becomes black after stomach and upper small intestine digesting. Peptic ulcers, gastritis, esophageal varices, and gastrointestinal cancers can produce melena. Melena can be a dangerous medical illness that requires immediate diagnosis and treatment.

Question: The FNP knows that during an abdominal assessment, deep palpation is used to determine

Answer: Deep palpation detects deeper lumps or organ enlargement during an abdominal evaluation. It lets the FNP evaluate organ size, shape, and consistency and find anomalies or soreness that light palpation may miss. Deep palpation evaluates the liver, spleen, kidneys, and bladder with gentle but strong pressure.

Question: The FNP is assessing the abdomen of an aging adult. Which of these statements regarding an aging adult and abdominal assessment is true?

Answer Changes in elderly adults can affect abdominal assessment. The abdomen may relax due to decreased abdominal muscular tone. Palpating abdominal tumors or anomalies is difficult due to abdominal muscular relaxation. Aging adults may have less fat cushioning, making abdominal organs more visible and palpable. The FNP must consider these age-related changes while assessing an aging adult's abdomen.

Question: During examination, the FNP finds that a patient has excessive dryness of the skin. The best term to describe this condition is

Answer Xerosis is skin dryness. Environmental variables (low humidity, dry air), hot water, harsh soaps and detergents, and medical problems (eczema, psoriasis) can cause xerosis. It causes itching, flaking, and tight skin.

Question: A FNP notices that a patient has ascites, which indicates the presence of

Answer Ascites is fluid collection in the peritoneal cavity between the abdominal organs and the abdominal wall. Liver illness, especially cirrhosis, causes it. Heart failure, kidney problems, cancer, and infections can cause ascites. Ascites indicates a disorder that requires additional assessment and management.

Question: The FNP is performing percussion during an abdominal assessment. Percussion notes during the abdominal assessment may include

Answer: The FNP taps the abdomen wall to produce sounds that can reveal underlying structures and organs during abdominal percussion. Abdominal assessment percussion notes may include:

Tympany: A high-pitched drum-like sound made by percussing air-filled structures like the stomach or intestines.

Dullness: A muffled sound when percussing solid organs like the liver or spleen.

Resonance: A hollow sound when percussing air-filled lungs.

Hyperresonance: When percussing over hyperinflated lungs, emphysema patients hear a louder, booming sound.

Percussing solid tissue or muscle produces a flat sound.

The FNP uses percussion sounds to determine abdominal organ size, density, position, and fluid, air, or solid masses.
