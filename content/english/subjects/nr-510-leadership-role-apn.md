# FAQs

Question 1: What is the most commonly reported symptom of cancer treatment?

Cancer treatment causes fatigue most often. Cancer and its treatment can weary the body and mind, causing fatigue and lethargy. Rest and sleep rarely help cancer-related weariness. It can greatly affect quality of life and daily functioning.

Question 2: Where are Langerhans cells found?

Langerhans cells are immune-responsive dendritic cells. They are mostly present in skin, mucous membranes, and other exterior tissues. Langerhans cells are plentiful in the epidermis of the skin, where they deliver antigens and start immunological responses to infections.

Question 3: An infant has a crescendo-decrescendo systolic ejection murmur located between the second and third intercostal spaces along the left sternal border. A wide fixed splitting of the second heart sound is also found. These clinical findings are consistent with which congenital heart defect?

A crescendo-decrescendo systolic ejection murmur with a wide fixed splitting of the second heart sound suggest Tetralogy of Fallot. VSD, overriding aorta, pulmonary valve stenosis, and right ventricular hypertrophy define tetralogy of Fallot. Pulmonary valve stenosis causes the murmur.

Question 4: Which statement is true concerning a fungal infection?

Antifungals can treat fungal infections. Mycoses—fungal infections—can damage the skin, nails, respiratory system, and internal organs. Azoles, polyenes, and echinocandins can cure fungal infections, depending on the type and severity.

Question 5: A hypersensitivity reaction that produces an allergic response is called:

Type I hypersensitivity reactions cause allergies. IgE antibodies cause acute hypersensitivity. Atopic individuals' immune systems overreact to allergens like pollen, dust mites, or certain foods, releasing mediators like histamine and causing allergic symptoms like itching, hives, sneezing, and wheezing.

Question 6: What period follows depolarization of the myocardium and represents a period during which no new cardiac potential can be propagated?

The absolute refractory time follows myocardial depolarization and prevents cardiac potential propagation. During repolarization, cardiac cells cannot respond to electrical stimuli. This phase allows the heart to finish each contraction-relaxation cycle and prevents aberrant electrical impulses from interrupting cardiac rhythm.

Question 7: Which renal change is found in older adults?

Kidney function and GFR deteriorate in older persons. Kidney function naturally declines with aging as nephrons shrink. This reduces GFR, waste filtering, and fluid and electrolyte balance. Age-related renal function changes might impair medication clearance and require dose adjustments for certain medications in older persons.

Question 8: Cystic fibrosis is caused by which process?

CFTR gene mutations cause cystic fibrosis. This mutation causes a faulty CFTR protein, which regulates chloride ions across cell membranes. Mutations in the CFTR protein cause problems in salt and water transport in the lungs, pancreas, and digestive tract. These anomalies produce cystic fibrosis symptoms and consequences.

Question 9: What is the most common predisposing factor to obstructive sleep apnea in children?

The most prevalent cause of recurrent breathing while sleeping among kids is Aden tonsillar thickening. Aden tonsillar hypertrophy, or swollen tonsils and adenoids, can block the upper airway during sleep and cause apnea (brief stopping of breathing). Obesity, craniofacial anomalies, neuromuscular issues, and medical diseases can cause obstructive breathing while sleeping in children.

Question 10: What is the major virus involved in the development of cervical cancer?

HPV causes cervical cancer. HPV-16 and HPV-18 are significantly linked to cervical cancer. HPV is a sexually transmitted illness that can lead to cervical cancer if left untreated. HPV vaccination and cancer screening are important preventive methods.
