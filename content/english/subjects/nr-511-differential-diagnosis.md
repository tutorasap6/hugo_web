## FAQs

Question 1: CO4 What is an Accountable Care Organization (ACO)?

ACOs increase care coordination and quality while lowering costs. ACOs are voluntary networks of hospitals, physicians, and other healthcare providers that provide coordinated care to a defined patient group. ACOs emphasize teamwork, care coordination, and evidence-based practices to enhance patient outcomes and population health. Value-based payment methods reward ACOs for quality and cost savings.

Question 2: CO2 A screening test identified correctly identified 80 individuals who did not have colon cancer out of 100 individuals that were known to be free of the disease (true negatives). Thus, the test failed to recognize 20 individuals who did not have colon cancer. What is the specificity of the screening test?

Specificity is a screening test's capacity to identify true negatives. The screening test correctly detected 80 of 100 colon cancer-free patients. Thus, screening test specificity is:

Specificity = (True Negatives/ (True Negatives + False Positives)) x 100

Specificity = 80/ (80+20) x 100

80% specific

Screening test specificity is 80%.

Question 3: CO1 Which of the following demonstrates a subjective finding?

Patient-reported subjective results cannot be directly observed or measured by the healthcare provider. They reflect the patient's thoughts and feelings. Subjective results include:

Pain: The patient describes pain location, intensity, and quality.

Fatigue: Patient feels exhausted.

Nausea: The patient feels nauseous.

Anxiety: The patient feels anxious.

The patient's self-report may make these findings unobservable or quantified.

Question 4: CO1 Which of the following demonstrates an objective finding?

Healthcare providers can observe, measure, or verify objective findings. They're founded on facts that can be tested. Objectivity includes:

High temperature: The doctor takes the patient's temperature.

Increased heart rate: The doctor checks the patient's pulse.

Swollen joint: The doctor observes the patient's joint swelling.

A stethoscope detects crackles or wheezes in the patient's lungs.

The doctor can document these observations.

Question 5: CO4 Most health maintenance organizations (HMOs) use a reimbursement mechanism called capitation. What does this mean?

HMOs employ capitation for reimbursement. Healthcare providers receive a fixed, predetermined payment for each enrolled individual in a given population or group under capitation, regardless of services supplied or use. Per-member-per-month (PMPM) payments are typical.

Capitation places financial risk and healthcare cost management on the healthcare provider. This payment model encourages clinicians to prioritize preventative care, service coordination, and cost-effective methods to provide comprehensive treatment within budget.

Question 6: CO4 The Affordable Care Act (ACA), which passed in 2010, has a number of provisions, including the establishment of health exchanges. The purpose of a health insurance exchange is to:

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) created health insurance exchanges to let individuals and small companies compare and buy health insurance coverage. Health insurance exchanges, often called marketplaces, offer ACA-compliant private health insurance.

Individuals and small businesses can compare health insurance plans' coverage, pricing, and quality ratings on the health insurance exchange. The exchange simplifies health insurance enrollment for individuals and small companies by promoting transparency, choice, and competition among insurance providers.

Question 7: CO4 What must you do as an advanced practice registered nurse (APRN) before billing for visits?

Before billing for visits, APRNs must complete various steps:

Get licensed: APRNs like nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, and clinical nurse specialists must be licensed and certified.

Enroll in insurance plans and get a provider number or National Provider Identifier (NPI) to bill for visits and get reimbursed.

Before treating a patient, check their insurance coverage to see if your services are covered. Eligibility, coverage, and preauthorization may be checked.

Billing requires accurate and complete patient visit documentation. Document services, procedures, and medical necessity.

Code visits correctly: Use CPT and ICD codes based on the patient's diagnosis and services provided.

Code and bill properly: Learn Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance coding and billing requirements. To get paid, follow these rules.

State and payer billing and reimbursement requirements differ, so it's important to stay current. For compliance and correct billing, consult your company's billing and coding department or a specialist.

Question 8: CO4 Which of the following statements about Medicaid is true?

Medicaid is a federal-state program that covers low-income individuals and families that fulfill qualifying requirements. Medicaid is true:

State-specific Medicaid eligibility and benefits: States run Medicaid, which is federal. Each state decides Medicaid eligibility and benefits. State eligibility, income limits, and covered services vary.

Medicaid eligibility is determined by income, household size, disability, and age. Medicaid covers medical visits, hospital treatment, prescription drugs, preventive services, and more for qualifying people and families.

Question 9: CO5 Which of the following statements does not belong in the past medical history portion of your chart note?

A chart note's past medical history section should not include the following statement:

Medication controls blood pressure.

Past medical history covers illnesses, injuries, operations, medical problems, and notable medical occurrences. It details the patient's medical history. Blood pressure control is more important to the patient's medical status and should be in the evaluation or medication portion of the chart notation.

Past medical history statements include:

"He had childhood asthma."

"The patient had a cholecystectomy in 2015."

"The patient has five-year-old type 2 diabetes."

These statements explain the patient's health status and medical history.

Question 10: CO5 In relation to writing a patient encounter note, the acronym SOAP stands for which of the following?

SOAP in patient interaction notes means: Subjective: The patient or caregiver's subjective complaints, symptoms, and relevant facts are included here. It may also include the patient's major complaint, current ailment, and relevant medical history.

Objective: The healthcare provider's physical examination, diagnostic tests, and other measurable data are in this section. Vital signs, lab reports, and other objective data are included.

Assessment: The doctor evaluates and interprets subjective and objective data. Based on the information collected, the provider's diagnosis, impression, or assessment is included.

Plan: The healthcare provider's treatment plan may include treatment choices, drugs, referrals to specialists, diagnostic testing, patient education, and follow-up instructions.
