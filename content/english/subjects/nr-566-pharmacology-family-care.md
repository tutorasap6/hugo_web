## FAQs

**Question: Which patients should penicillins be used with extreme caution?**

Anaphylaxis patients should utilize penicillins with caution. Patients with a strong allergy to one beta-lactam antibiotic may be more likely to react to other types.

**Question: To treat otitis media, would you use a broad-spectrum or narrow-spectrum antibiotic?**

Narrow-spectrum antibiotics are recommended for uncomplicated otitis media. When the causal bacterium is sensitive to the antibiotic, narrow-spectrum drugs are chosen. Clinical guidelines recommend treating simple otitis media with amoxicillin.

**Question: What baseline data is needed to prescribe trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole? (Select all that apply)**

Before prescribing trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, baseline data may include:

Medical history, particularly sulfa drug or antibiotic responses.

Sulfa drug allergies, to check.

Renal function testing, as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is excreted by the kidneys. Patients with compromised renal function may need dose changes.

This antibiotic may not be suggested for pregnant or intending pregnant women.

Drug interactions from concurrent drugs.

The patient's health status and clinical situation will determine the specific data needed.

**Question: Which antibiotic class is most likely to be used empirically if there are no contraindications?**

When there are no contraindications and a wide spectrum of microorganisms is detected, fluoroquinolone antibiotics are often administered experimentally. Fluoroquinolones can kill Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
