## FAQs

Question: The primary risk for injury experienced by a client with asthma is ANS:

Answer Respiratory discomfort or aggravation is asthmatics' main injury risk. Asthma causes wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath due to airway inflammation and constriction. Airways narrow during asthma attacks and exacerbations, making it hard for clients to breathe. Respiratory failure can develop from severe respiratory distress. To reduce harm, asthma management focuses on preventing and treating respiratory distress.

Question: Which intervention demonstrates effective care for an individual who has expressed a wish to "retire sometime soon"?

Answer: Educating and supporting someone who wants to "retire sometime soon" is a useful intervention. Discussing retirement finances, creating a retirement savings strategy, and researching retirement benefits and resources are examples. Additionally, addressing the individual's emotional and psychological preparedness for retirement and helping them plan meaningful activities during retirement might be beneficial.

Question: Which intervention addresses a guiding principle for creating an elder-friendly acute care facility?

Answer Age-friendly design is one way to make an acute care facility elder-friendly. This involves making the facility accessible to seniors. Age-friendly design includes clear signage, handrails in hallways, well-lit places, non-slip flooring, comfortable seats, and accessible amenities. These design characteristics help older individuals feel safe, independent, and comfortable in an elder-friendly care environment.

Question: Which characteristic is present in a family's 'kin-keeper'?

Answer: A family's 'kin-keeper' coordinates and maintains familial links, communication, and caregiving. The kin-keeper usually organizes family gatherings, keeps in touch with extended relatives, and provides support and aid when needed. They promote family unity and well-being.

Question: The nurse practitioner is providing care for an older client who is experiencing mild cognitive impairment. Which communication technique is most likely to bring about a negative outcome?

Answer: Complex or unclear language is most likely to harm an older customer with minor cognitive impairment. Cognitively impaired older persons may have trouble understanding complex or abstract topics. Complexity, jargon, and ambiguity can cause misunderstanding, annoyance, and miscommunication. To improve understanding and communication with older clients with cognitive impairment, nurse practitioners should utilize clear, plain, and concrete language.

Question: Which of the following does not demonstrate an understanding of the factors affecting the physical wellness of the older adult client when:

Answer: This question is unanswerable without choices. Please suggest choices to improve response.

Question: Research has shown that long-term care (LTC) facility nursing

Answer: Answering the incomplete sentence is tough. I'll help if you provide me the full statement of what you need.

Question: An older client with dementia resides with his daughter. When the home care nurse visits, the daughter tearfully tells the nurse that her father scratched her hand and cursed at her when she was attempting to feed him. She states, "I don't know why he hates me and wants to hurt me. I try so hard to take good care of him. I love him." How will the nurse respond to the client's daughter?

Answer: The nurse should sympathize with the client's daughter. "I can see how upsetting and distressing this situation is for you," the nurse can say to the girl. Dementia patients can act out, making caregiving difficult. Remember that your father's behaviors don't represent his emotions for you. He may not control his actions due to dementia. Let's find ways to regulate these behaviors to protect you and your father."

Question: What factor is an important contribution to polypharmacy in older adults?

Answer Polypharmacy in elderly persons is caused by several circumstances. Multiple chronic conditions are important. Multiple medical issues in older persons may require different drugs. Older persons may often see many doctors who prescribe drugs independently, which can lead to overlapping or conflicting prescriptions. Polypharmacy is also caused by poor medication review and monitoring, prescription non-adherence, self-medication with over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, and potentially unsuitable medications. Older persons with polypharmacy may have more adverse drug events, drug interactions, and medication issues.
