## FAQs

Question 1: A sexually active 18-year-old presents with postcoital spotting, dysuria, and a yellow discharge. On exam, you find her cervix is erythematous and bleeds with contact. The most likely diagnosis is:

Cervicitis is the most likely diagnosis. Infection, usually from STIs such Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae, causes cervicitis. Cervicitis is characterized by postcoital bleeding, dysuria, yellow discharge, and an erythematous cervix that bleeds upon contact. Test and treat the underlying infection.

Question 2: One of the leading causes of female infertility, Stein-Leventhal syndrome is:

Stein-Leventhal syndrome (PCOS) is a leading cause of female infertility. Multiple tiny cysts in the ovaries, irregular or nonexistent menstrual periods, and elevated androgens (male hormones) are symptoms of PCOS. Ovulation malfunction and infertility can result. Hirsutism, acne, and obesity may occur.

Question 3: HIV test is indicated for a(n):

HIV testing is recommended for high-risk populations or routine screening. These people may be tested for HIV:

Unprotected intercourse with several partners or HIV-positive people.

Sharing injectable drug needles or syringes.

Pregnant ladies to prevent mother-to-child transmission.

Acute retroviral syndrome or HIV-related disease patients.

HIV-prevention candidates seeking PrEP or PEP.

To determine HIV testing, evaluate risk factors and talk to patients.

Question 4: Which of the following contraceptive methods would be best for a woman with sickle cell anemia?

Sickle cell anemia patients should use contraceptives that are safe and low-risk. Sickle cell anemia-friendly contraceptives include:

Hormonal methods: Estrogen-progestin COCs are safe for sickle cell anemia patients. They control menstrual cycles and prevent pregnancy. Since disease severity and complications vary, the patient should discuss the risks and advantages.

Progestin-only techniques Progestin-only contraceptives such mini-pills, Depo-Provera, Nexplanon, and hormonal intrauterine devices (IUDs) like Mirena may be suitable. Women with sickle cell anemia may prefer these treatments because estrogen may raise the risk of thromboembolic events.

A healthcare provider should evaluate the patient's medical history, preferences, and any contraindications before recommending a contraceptive technique.

Question 5: A patient taking metronidazole and cimetidine at the same time is at risk for:

Cimetidine and metronidazole can interact. Cimetidine reduces stomach acid, whereas metronidazole treats infections. Cimetidine may raise metronidazole levels and negative effects.

This combination may exacerbate CNS symptoms like disorientation, dizziness, and seizures. If both medications are needed, doctors must be aware of this combination and alter dosage or monitor the patient.

Question 6: A 58-year-old woman complains of severe vulvar pruritus. On examination of the vulva, you note thinning of the epidermis and loss of pigmentation, as well as maculopapular lesions. You suspect the diagnosis may be:

The described symptoms and findings suggest the possibility of lichen sclerosus. Lichen sclerosus is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that commonly affects the anogenital area, including the vulva. It is more common in postmenopausal women but can occur at any age. The characteristic features include severe itching (pruritus), thinning of the epidermis, loss of pigmentation, and the presence of maculopapular lesions. Diagnosis is confirmed through a biopsy, and treatment typically involves the use of topical corticosteroids.

Question 7: Measuring waist circumference is most appropriate when the client's BMI places her in which of the following categories?

If the client's BMI is overweight or obese, measure waist circumference. Height and weight-based BMI is used to measure body fat. BMI may not fully assess health risk. Waist circumference helps analyze body fat distribution, especially abdominal fat, which increases health risks.

Measure waist circumference in these categories:

BMI > 25 kg/m2 (overweight category): Waist circumference can identify people with extra abdominal fat, which increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other health problems.

BMI < 30 kg/m2 (obese category): Central obesity (excess belly fat) increases the risk of metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and other health issues.

These rules may fluctuate depending on population suggestions or organization guidelines.

Question 8: The levonorgestrel-releasing IUD may be a better choice than the copper-releasing IUD for a woman who:

If the client's BMI is overweight or obese, measure waist circumference. Height and weight-based BMI is used to measure body fat. BMI may not fully assess health risk. Waist circumference helps analyze body fat distribution, especially abdominal fat, which increases health risks.

Measure waist circumference in these categories:

BMI > 25 kg/m2 (overweight category): Waist circumference can identify people with extra abdominal fat, which increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other health problems.

BMI < 30 kg/m2 (obese category): Central obesity (excess belly fat) increases the risk of metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and other health issues.

These rules may fluctuate depending on population suggestions or organization guidelines.

Question 9: A 30-year-old is seen in your office on day 18 of her cycle for her routine annual examination. She has no complaints. Pelvic exam reveals a 9-cm firm, pelvic mass anterior to the uterus. The most likely diagnosis is:

The 9-cm hard pelvic lump anterior to the uterus is likely an ovarian cyst based on the information supplied. Fluid-filled ovarian cysts can form. They're prevalent and can be caused by menstruation or other disorders.

A 9-cm ovarian cyst is significant and may need further monitoring. Ultrasounds can reveal the cyst's features and potential problems. Depending on the findings and patient's condition, follow-up or surgery may be considered.

Question 10: First-line treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome is: PCOS treatment initially addresses symptoms and hormonal abnormalities. PCOS treatments include:

Lifestyle changes: Diet, exercise, and weight loss (if overweight or obese) can improve insulin sensitivity, menstrual cycles, and PCOS symptoms.

Oral contraceptives (birth control pills): Estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives are typically recommended to regulate menstrual periods and control testosterone levels. They also treat acne and hirsutism.

Anti-androgen drugs like spironolactone help diminish hirsutism and acne.

Insulin-sensitizing medications: Metformin can improve insulin resistance and normalize menstrual periods in PCOS patients.
