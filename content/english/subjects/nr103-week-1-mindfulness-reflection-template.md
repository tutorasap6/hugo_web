### A number of health habits were discussed in this week’s video. Which, if any, of the healthy habits do you already use in your daily regimen?

After watching the video series about the introduction of mindfulness, it made me much more aware of the things that stress me on a day-to-day basis. My day usually consists of me waking up in the morning, thinking for a second about what tasks I need to do that day, and then jumping into the shower to wake myself up. I currently use a few of the healthy habits mentioned in the video in my daily regimen. For example, I focus on maintaining a balanced diet, staying hydrated, and getting sufficient sleep.

A balanced diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains, is essential for maintaining good health and energy levels throughout the day. Research indicates that a nutritious diet can help prevent chronic diseases and support overall well-being ([Boeing et al., 2012](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00394-012-0380-y)). Additionally, I make a conscious effort to drink plenty of water throughout the day to stay hydrated, which is crucial for bodily functions and cognitive performance (Popkin, D’Anci, & Rosenberg, 2010).

Getting enough sleep is another healthy habit I prioritize. Ensuring I get at least 7 hours of sleep each night helps my body recover and prepares me mentally and physically for the day ahead. Quality sleep is vital for maintaining cognitive function, emotional balance, and overall health (Hirshkowitz et al., 2015).

## Are there habits mentioned in the video that you do not currently use?

There are numerous health habits mentioned in the video series that I do not currently practice. For instance, I rarely take the time to meditate or engage in mindfulness exercises. My mornings are typically rushed, and I often find myself focusing solely on the tasks I need to accomplish rather than taking a moment to center myself and set a positive tone for the day.

## Which habits will you consider adding into your routine?

I am considering adding several of the mindfulness practices discussed in the video series into my daily routine. One of the techniques I found particularly interesting is the 4-7-8 breathing technique. This method, which involves inhaling for four seconds, holding the breath for seven seconds, and exhaling for eight seconds, is designed to promote relaxation and reduce anxiety (Weil, 2015). Incorporating this technique into my routine could help me manage stress more effectively.

Another practice I am interested in adopting is body scan meditation. This technique involves mentally scanning the body from head to toe, paying attention to any areas of tension or discomfort. By focusing on the present moment in an open and non-judgmental manner, body scan meditation can increase awareness of physical sensations and promote relaxation (Kabat-Zinn, 1990). Including this practice in my daily regimen, either in the morning or before bed, could enhance my overall sense of well-being.

Additionally, I plan to incorporate regular mindfulness meditation sessions into my routine. Research has shown that mindfulness meditation can reduce stress, improve concentration, and enhance emotional well-being (Goyal et al., 2014). By dedicating just 5-10 minutes each morning and evening to meditation, I can start and end my day with a calm and focused mind.

In conclusion, reflecting on my current habits and considering new ones to adopt has highlighted the importance of a balanced and mindful approach to health. While I already practice some healthy habits, such as maintaining a balanced diet, staying hydrated, and getting sufficient sleep, there is always room for improvement. By incorporating mindfulness techniques like the 4-7-8 breathing method, body scan meditation, and regular mindfulness meditation into my daily routine, I can better manage stress and enhance my overall well-being. Continuous self-improvement and a commitment to adopting new healthy habits are essential for leading a balanced and fulfilling life.
